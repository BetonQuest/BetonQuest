# Objectives List

## Location: `location`

This objective completes when player moves in specified range of specified location and meets all conditions. The first argument after objective's name must be location, the second - radius around the location. It can be a variable.

Location objective contains one property, `location`. It's a string formatted like `X: 100, Y: 200, Z:300`.

**Example**: `location 100;200;300;world 5 condition:test1,!test2 events:test1,test2`

## Block: `block`

To complete this objective player must break or place specified amount of blocks. First argument after name is type of the block and data value after a colon (WOOD:2 means birch wooden planks). You can find possible types at Bukkit reference page there: [material types](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html). Next is amount. It can be more than 0 for placing and less than 0 for destroying. You can also use `notify` keyword to display messages to the player each time he updates amount of blocks, optionally with the notification interval after colon.

This objective has two properties, `amount` and `left`. Amount is current amount of blocks in the objective, left is amount needed to complete the objective. Note that it may sometimes be negative!

**Example**: `block LOG:2 -16 events:reward notify:5`

## Mob Kill: `mobkill`

The player must kill specified amount of mobs You must specify mob type first and then amount. You can find possible mob types here: [mob types](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html). Additionally you can specify names for mobs with `name:Uber_Zombie`, so only killing properly named mobs counts. All `_` are replaced with spaces, so in this example you would have to kill 5 zombies with "Uber Zombie" above their heads. You can also specify `notify` keyword to display messages to the player each time he kills a mob, optionally with the notification interval after colon. If you want to accept only mobs marked with `spawn` event, use `marked:` argument followed by the keyword used in that event.

This objective also has two properties, `amount` and `left`. Amount is current amount of killed mobs, left is amount needed to complete the objective.

**Example**: `mobkill ZOMBIE 5 name:Uber_Zombie conditions:night`

## Action: `action`

This objective completes when player clicks on given block type. This can be further limited by location condition and item in hand condition. First argument is type of the click, it can be right, left or any. Next is block type, optionally with data value after colon. You can also specify `loc:` argument, followed by standard location format and `range:` followed by a number (or variable). It will define where the clicked block needs to be, as opposed to "where you must be" in location condition. If you add argument `cancel`, the click will be canceled (chest will not open, button will not be pressed etc.)

Action objective contains one property, `location`. It's a string formatted like `X: 100, Y: 200, Z:300`. It does not show the radius.

**Example**: `action right DOOR:1 conditions:holding_key loc:100;200;300;world range:5`

## Death: `die`

Death objective completes when the player dies meeting all conditions. You can optionally cancel death with `cancel` argument. It will heal player and optionally teleport him to respawn location. There can be two arguments: `cancel`, which is optional, and `respawn:`, which is also optional and only used if there is the `cancel` argument set. You can add them right after type of objective.

**Example**: `die cancel respawn:100;200;300;world;90;0 events:teleport`

## Crafting: `craft`

To complete this objective the player must craft specified item. First argument is ID of the item, as in _items.yml_. Next is amount (integer).

Crafting objective has two properties, `amount` and `left`. Amount is current amount of crafted items and left is amount needed to complete the objective.

**Example**: `craft saddle 5 events:reward`

## Smelting: `smelt`

To complete this objective player must smelt specified item. Note that you must define item as output from furnace, not the ingredient. This one does not support data values (it doesnâ€™t have to). First argument is material name. Next is amount (integer).

Smelting has the same properties as crafting objective.

**Example**: `smelt IRON_INGOT 5 events:reward`

## Taming: `tame`

To complete this objective player must tame some amount of mobs. valid mob types are: WOLF, OCELOT and HORSE First argument is type, next is amount.

Taming has the same properties as mob kill objective.

**Example**: `tame WOLF 2 events:wolfs_tamed`

## Delay: `delay`

This objective is just a long, persistent delay for firing events. It will run only after certain amount of time (measured in minutes) and only when player is online and meets all conditions. If a player is offline at that time it will just wait for them to log in. You should use it for example to delete tags so the player can complete quests multiple times. First argument is time, by default in minutes. You can also use `ticks` or `seconds` argument to use different units, but keep in mind that it's not very precise - it will complete roughly after the time ends. To control that precision you can specify an optional `interval:` argument, which specifies how many ticks should pass between checks. One second is 20 ticks. Less makes the objective more precise, at the expense of performance. The rest is just like in other objectives.

Delay has two properties, `left` and `date`. The first one will show how much time needs to pass before the delay is completed (i.e. `23 days, 5 hours and 45 minutes`), the second one will show a date of completing the objective formatted using `date_format` setting in _config.yml_ (it will look like the one above every journal entry).

**Example**: `delay 1000 ticks interval:5 events:event1,event2`

## Arrow Shooting: `arrow`

To complete this objective the player needs to shoot the arrow into the target. There are two arguments, location of the target and precision number (radius around location where the arrow must land, should be small). Note that the position of an arrow after hit is on the wall of a _full_ block, which means that shooting not full blocks (like heads) won't give accurate results. Experiment with this objective a bit to make sure you've set the numbers correctly.

**Example**: `arrow 100.5;200.5;300.5;world 1.1 events:reward conditions:correct_player_position`

## Experience: `experience`

This objective can by completed by reaching specified level (default Minecraft experience, whole levels). The conditions are checked when the player levels up, so if they are not met the first time, the player will have to meet them and levelup again. Instruction string consists only from integer - level to reach.

**Example**: `experience 25 events:reward`

## Step on pressure plate: `step`

To complete this objective the player has to step on pressure plate at given location. The type of plate does not matter. The first and only required argument is a location. If the pressure plate is not present at that location, the objective will not be completable and will log errors in the console.

Step objective contains one property, `location`. It's a string formatted like `X: 100, Y: 200, Z:300`. It shows an exact location of the pressure plate.

**Example**: `step 100;200;300;world events:done`

## Logout: `logout`

To complete this objective the player simply needs to leave the server. Keep in mind that running `folder` event here will make it run in "persistent" mode, since the player is offline on the next tick.

**Example**: `logout events:delete_objective`

## Password: `password`

This objective requires the player to type the password in the chat. The first argument is the password. All `_` characters are replaced with spaces. It's checked with [regular expressions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) (if your password will be `^beton.*beton$` the objective will accept all passwords that starts and ends with `beton` word (`^` represents beginning of a string, `.` represents any character, `*` allows the previous character (in this case any) repeat any number of times, and `$` means end of the string), but you can also use something like `beton` - it will work). If you want the objective to ignore case of the letters you can add optional `ignoreCase` argument. For this to work your regular expression needs to use lower case letters. To answer, the player needs to type (in his language, configurable in _messages.yml_) `password: here goes player's guess`. If he fails, the message will not be displayed in the chat.

**Example**: `password beton ignoreCase events:message,reward`

## Fishing: `fish`

Requires the player to catch a fish. It doesn't have to be a fish, it can also be a treasure or junk. The first argument is [material](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html) name of the item to catch, optionally with data value after a colon. Second argument must be amount of fish to catch. You can also add `notify` argument if you want to display progress, optionally with the notification interval after colon.

Fishing has the same properties as mob kill objective.

**Example**: `fish raw_fish:1 5 notify events:tag_fish_caught`

## Sheep shearing: `shear`

To complete this objective the player has to shear specified amount of sheep, optionally with specified color and/or name. The first, required argument is amount (integer). Optionally, you can add `name:` argument with the name and `color:` with [color name](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/DyeColor.html).

Sheep shearing has the same properties as mob kill objective.

**Example**: `shear 1 name:Bob color:black`

## Enchant item: `enchant`

This objectie is completed when the player enchants specified item with specified enchantment. The first argument is an item name, as defined it _items.yml_. Second one is the [enchantment](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html) and a level, separated with a colon.

**Example**: `enchant sword damage_all:1 events:reward`

## Put items in a chest: `chestput`

This objective requires the player to put specified items in a specified chest. First argument is a location of the chest, second argument is a list of items (from _items.yml_ file), separated with a comma. You can also add amount of items after a colon. The items will be removed upon completing the objective unless you add `items-stay` optional argument.

**Example**: `chestput 100;200;300;world emerald:5,sword events:tag,message`

## Potion brewing: `potion`

To complete this objective the player needs to brew specified amount of specified potions. The first argument is a potion ID from _items.yml_. Second argument is amount of potions. You can optionally add `notify` argument to make the objective display progress to players, optionally with the notification interval after colon.

The brewing will be accepted if the player was the last one to click the ingredient slot in the brewing stand and there were no matching potions there already.

Potion objective has `amount` and `left:` properties.

**Example**: `potion weird_concoction 4 event:add_tag`

## Eat/drink: `consume`

This objective is completed by eating specified food or drinking specified potion. The only required argument is the ID of an item from _items.yml_.

**Example**: `consume tawny_owl events:faster_endurance_regen`

## Variable: `variable`

This objective is different. You cannot complete it, it will also ignore defined events and conditions. You can start it and that's it. While this objective is active though, everything the player types in chat (and matches special pattern) will become a variable. The pattern is `key: value`. So if you type that, it will create a variable called `key`, which will resolve to `value` string. These are not global variables, you can access them as objective properties. Let's say you defined this objective as `var` in your _objectives.yml_ file. You can access the variable in any conversation, event or condition with `%objective.var.key%` - and in case of this example, it will resolve to `value`. The player can type something else, and the variable will change its value. Variables are per-player, so my `key` variable will be different from your `key` variable, depending on what we were typing in chat. You can have as much variables here as you want. To remove this objective use `objective delete` event - there is no other way.

You can also use `variable` event to change variables stored in this objective. There is one optional argument, `no-chat`. If you use it, the objective won't be modified by what players type in chat.

**Example**: `variable`

## Kill player: `kill`

To complete this objective the player needs to kill another player. The first argument is amount of players to kill. You can also specify additional arguments: `name:` followed by the name will only accept killing players with this name, `required:` followed by a list of conditions separated with commas will only accept killing players meeting these conditions and `notify` will display notifications when a player is killed, optionally with the notification interval after colon.

**Example**: `kill 5 required:team_B`

## Breed animals: `breed`

**This works only on Spigot 1.10.2 and later!**

This objective is completed by breeding animals of specified type. The first argument is animal type ([types](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html)) and second is amount (positive integer). You can add `notify` argument to display a message with remaining amount each time the animal is bred, optionally with the notification interval after colon. While you can specify any entity, the objective will be completable only for breedable ones.

**Example**: `breed cow 10 notify:2 events:reward`

## Interact with entity: `interact`

The player must click on an entity to complete this objective. The first argument is the type of a click. Available values are `right`, `left` and `any`. Second required argument is the [mob type](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html). Next is an amount of mobs required to click on. These must be unique, so the player can't simply click twenty times on the same zombie to complete it. There is also an optional `name:` parameter which specifies what name the entity must have and `marked:` if the clicked entity needs to be marked by the `spawn` event (see its description for marking explanation). You can also add `notify` argument to make the objective notify players whenever they click a correct entity, optionally with the notification interval after colon and `cancel` if the click shouldn't do what it usually does (i.e. left click won't hurt the entity).

**Example**: `interact right creeper 1 marked:sick condition:syringeInHand cancel`
