# Configuration

The configuration of BetonQuest is mainly done in the `config.yml` file. All of its options are described on this page.
There is also additional information about backups, updates and database transfers.
If you fail to understand options just keep their default values. You can always change them when
you have gained a more complete understanding of this plugin. 


## Config Options

!!! warning
    **Do not touch `version:` option! It may corrupt your files!**


### MySQL Database

#### Setup

In order to use a MySQL Database for saving all the data you need to fill out the mysql config section.
``` YAML linenums="1"
mysql:
  enabled: true   #Set this to true.
  host: ''        #This is the IP of your MySQL server. If it runs on the same machine as your server use localhost or 127.0.0.1 
  port: ''        #This is the port your MySQL server runs on.
  user: ''        #The name of the database user that is used to connect to the database server.
  pass: ''        #The password of that user.
  base: ''        #The database that BetonQuest will write to. You need to create it in your database server.
  prefix: betonquest_  #The table prefix of BetonQuest's data in the database.
```


#### Migrating a database from SQLite to MySQL and back

Follow these few simple steps to migrate your database easily:

1. Create a backup with **/q backup** command.
2. Extract database backup from it.
3. Turn the server off.
4. Place the _database-backup.yml_ file inside the plugin's directory.
5. Edit which database type you want to use by setting the `enabled` option in the `mysql` section to true or false.
6. Start the server.
7. Check for errors.
8. If there are no errors, enjoy your migrated database.
9. If there are any errors, post them to the developer or try to fix them if you know how.

### Default Language
 
`language:` is the default translation of the plugin for every new player. Currently, there are 9 languages available: 
English (en), Polish (pl), German (de), French (fr), Spanish (es), Chinese (cn), Dutch (nl), Italian (it) and Hungarian (hu).

### Updating
The `update` section controls the Auto-Updater. It has the following settings:

* `enabled` (default `true`). Enables or disables the Updater. If set to false, it is not possible to update with the
  updater and no version checks are executed.
* `strategy` (default `MINOR`). The update strategy is the most important feature of the Auto-Updater. An explanation is
  available [here](./Updating.md#choose-an-update-strategy).
* `automatic` (default `true`). If true the updater will download new Versions automatically. Otherwise, the updater
  will only download new versions when the update command is executed. Advice is
  available [here](./Updating.md#enable-or-disable-automatic-updates).

### Journal slots

`default_journal_slot` is the inventory slot in which the journal will appear after using the `/journal` command.
BetonQuest will try to move items out of the way if the slot is occupied. If the inventory is full the journal will not
be added. You can disable this behaviour by setting the option to `-1`. BetonQuest will then just use any free slot.

### Citizens identifier

`citizens_npcs_by_name` sets whether NPCs from Citizens 2 should be identified in package.yml by their name instead of
their id. This is a dangerous setting as two different NPC's at the opposite edges of your world that share the same
name by accident will trigger the same quest.

### Citizens left click

`acceptNPCLeftClick` activates that a conversation with an NPC can also be started by left clicking the NPC and not only
by right clicking the NPC.

### Citizens interact limit

`npcInteractionLimit` prevents NPC / BetonQuest conversation click spamming. The time's unit is milliseconds. Default
value: `500`

### Conversation End Distance

`max_npc_distance` is the distance you need to walk away from the NPC for the conversation to end (in the case of using
chat-based conversation interface).

### Default conversation style

`default_conversation_IO` is a comma-separated list of conversation interfaces with the first valid one used.
Read [this page](Conversations.md) for more information about conversation interfaces.

### Default Chat interceptor

`default_interceptor` is a comma-separated list of chat interceptors with the first valid one used.
Read [this page](Conversations.md) for more information about chat interceptors.

### Conversation Chat Display options
`display_chat_after_conversation` this will prevent all chat messages from displaying during a conversation and it will show them once it's finished.

### Combat Delay
`combat_delay` is a delay (in seconds) the player must wait before starting a conversation after combat.

### Conversation pullback message
`notify_pullback` will display a message every time the player is pulled back by the `stop` option in conversations (in the case of chat-based conversations).
It notifies players that they are in a conversation, and the pullback is not a bug.

### Adjusting the backpack to the KeepInventory gamerule
`remove_items_after_respawn` option should be turned on if "keepInventory" gamerule is not being used. 
It prevents other plugins from duplicating quest items after death.

When a player dies, their quest items are removed from drops and stored in the backpack, but some plugins may try to
restore all items to the player (for example WorldGuard custom flag keep-inventory).
That is why BetonQuest removes the quest items that are in a player's inventory after they respawn again, to be sure they were not readded. 
The "keepInventory" gamerule, however, works differently - the items are never dropped, so they cannot be added to backpack. 
Removing them from the inventory would destroy them forever. Sadly, Bukkit does not allow for gamerule checking, so it is up to you to decide.

Once again, if you have "keepInventory" gamerule true, this setting has to be false and vice versa.
    
### Quest Items break behaviour
`quest_items_unbreakable` controls whether quest items can be broken by using them.
This was used in the past when the `unbreakable` tag couldn't be added to items.
Turn it off and make your quest items unbreakable by vanilla means.

### Player Hider interval
`player_hider_check_interval` the interval in which the PlayerHider checks the conditions and updates the player's visibility.
Cannot be disabled currently. If you want this to be semi-disabled set a very high value. 

### NPC Hider interval
`npc_hider_check_interval` is the interval in which the NPCHider checks the conditions and updates the NPC's visibility.
Cannot be disabled currently. If you want this to be semi-disabled set a very high value.

### Sounds
This section defines what sounds will be played on these occasions:

  * `start` and `end` refer to start and end points of conversations.
  * `journal` is played upon updating the journal.
  * `update` is played when there is a changelog file, used to draw your attention.
  * `full` is played when the player executes `/journal` but his inventory is full.
  
  
A list of all possible sounds for the latest Minecraft version can be found [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Sound.html).
    
### Conversation Command Banlist
`cmd_blacklist` is a list of commands that cannot be used during a conversation. Remember that you can only type single words (command names) here!

### Compatibility Hooks
`hook` controls compatibility with other plugins. You can turn off each hook here.

### Journal
`journal` controls various settings of the journal:

  * `chars_per_page` is the number of characters before a page break. If it is set too high, the text on a journal page can overflow and become invisible.
   **This was replaced by `chars_per_line` and `lines_per_page` and is only required if you don't like the new behaviour.**
  * `chars_per_line` is the number of characters before a line break.
   If it is set too high, the text on a journal page can overflow and become invisible.
   If this is not set, BQ will fall back on the old page wrapping behaviour configured through `chars_per_page`.
  * `lines_per_page` is the number of lines before a new page. If it is set too high, the text on a journal page can overflow and become invisible. 
   This is only required if `chars_per_line` is set.
  * `one_entry_per_page` makes each entry take a single page. Note that it will not expand to other pages even if it overflows, so keep your entries short.
  * `reversed_order` controls the chronological order of entries in the journal. By default, the entries are ordered from newest to oldest.
   It is reversible, but this will force players to click through many pages to get to the most recent entry.
  * `hide_date` hides the date of each entry. Set it to true if you don't want this functionality.
  * `full_main_page` makes the main page always take a full page. If a lot of information is being displayed, it is advised to make this true.
   If you use the main page only for small notifications, set it to false, so the entries can follow immediately.
  * `show_separator` shows a separator between journal entries (default: true). Customize the separator in `messages.yml` with the key `journal_separator`.
  * `show_in_backpack` whether to display the journal in the backpack when there is no journal in the player's inventory.
  * `lock_default_journal_slot` locks the journal to the `default_journal_slot`.
  * `give_on_respawn` adds the journal to the player inventory.
  
### Journal Colors
`journal_colors` controls the colors used in the journal. It takes color codes without the `&` character.

  * `date.day` is the day number
  * `date.hour` is the hour number
  * `line` is the delimiter between entries
  * `text` is the text of the entry
    
### Conversation Colors
`conversation_colors` controls the colors of the conversation. It takes [color names](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/ChatColor.html). 
If you want to add a font style (bold, italic etc.) do so after placing a comma.

  * `npc` is the name of the NPC
  * `player` is the name of the player
  * `text` is the NPC's text
  * `answer` is the text of player's answer (after choosing it)
  * `number` is the option number
  * `option` is the text of an option

### Conversation Settings: ChestIO

* `conversation_IO_config` manages settings for individual conoversation IO's:
  - `chest` manages settings for the chest conversation IO
    - `show_number` will show the player number option if true (default: true)
    - `show_npc_text` will show the npc text in every player option if true (default: true)

### Quest downloader

`download` controls security restrictions for the [`/q download`](Commands-and-permissions.md) command:

* `pullrequests` defines if pull requests may be downloaded. **Only enable this if you really know what you are doing!**
  Everyone can open pull requests that could contain malicious files and if a permission misconfiguration occurs this
  will make your server vulnerable to attacks.
* `repo_whitelist` is a list of trusted github repositories from which quests and templates can be downloaded.  
  By default only or official tutorial repo [BetonQuest/Quest-Tutorials](https://github.com/BetonQuest/Quest-Tutorials)
  is on this list.

### Items

`items` gives the possibility to override default items, that are defined and used by BetonQuest.
The items need to be defined in a package, and then you need to reference the item here with an absolute path.

* `backpack` items that are used by the backpack.
  - `previous_button` the item to go to the previous page of items in the backpack.
  - `next_button` the item to go to the next page of items in the backpack.
  - `cancel_button` the item to show the quest cancelers.  
  - `compass_button` the item to show the quest compass.

### Misc settings

* `date_format` is the Java [date format](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html)
  used in journal dates. It needs to have a space between the day and hour.
* `debug` is responsible for logging the plugin's activity to _debug.log_ file in _logs_ directory. Turning this on can
  slow your server down. However, if you experience any errors, turn this on and let the plugin gather the data and send
  logs to the developer. Note that the first run of the plugin will be logged anyway, just as a precaution.
