# [HolographicDisplays](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/holographic-displays).

This is an older hologram plugin.

!!! info
    Holographic Displays integration supports [BetonQuest Hologram](./index.md) features.

!!! warning "Potential lags"
    The HolographicDisplays documentation warns against using too many individual hologram placeholders since they are rendered
    for each player individually. If you are using HolographicDisplays to save resources, it is recommended to minimize the use of non-static placeholders.
