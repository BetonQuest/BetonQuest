!!! example
    ```YAML
    advancement minecraft:adventure/kill_a_mob
    ```

## Conjunction: `and`

**static**

Conjunction of specified conditions. This means that every condition has to be met in order for conjunction to be true. Used only in complex alternatives, because conditions generally work as conjunction. Instruction string is exactly the same as in `alternative`.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    and has_helmet,has_chestplate,has_leggings,has_boots
    ```

## Armor: `armor`

The armor condition requires the player to wear an armor that has been specified in the _items_ section.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    armor helmet_of_concrete
    ```

```

## Check conditions: `check`

**persistent**, **static**

This condition allow for specifying multiple instruction strings in one, longer string. Each instruction must be started with `^` character and no other dividers should be used. The condition will be met if all inner conditions are met. It's not the same as `and` condition, because you can specify an instruction string, not a condition name.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    check ^tag beton ^item emerald:5 ^location 100;200;300;survival_nether;5 ^experience 20
    ```

## Chest Item: `chestitem` 

**persistent**, **static**

This condition works in the same way as `item` condition, but it checks the specified chest instead of a player. The first argument is a location of the chest and the second one is the list of items defined in the same way as in `item` condition. If there is no chest at specified location the condition won't be met.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    chestitem 100;200;300;world emerald:5,sword
    ```

## Conversation: `conversation`

This condition will check if a conversation has an available starting option. If no starting option has a condition that returns true then this will return false.

    conversation innkeeper
    ```

## Day of week: `dayofweek`

It must be a specific day of the week that this condition returns true. You can specify either the english name of the day or the number of the day (1 being monday, 7 sunday,..).

!!! example

    ```
 
## Potion Effect: `effect`

To meet this condition the player must have an active potion effect. There is only one argument and it takes values from this page: [potion types](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html).

!!! example
    ```YAML
    effect SPEED
    ```

## Empty inventory slots: `empty`

To meet this condition the players inventory must have the specified amount of empty slots or more.
If you want to check for a specific amount (for example for a full inventory with 0 empty slots) you can append the `equal` argument.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    empty 5
    ```

## Entities in area: `entities` 

**persistent**, **static**

This condition will return true only if there is a specified amount (or more) of specified entities in the specified area. 
There are three required arguments - entity type, location and range. Entities are defined as a list separated by commas.
Each entity type (taken from [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html))
can have an additional amount suffix, for example `ZOMBIE:5,SKELETON:2` means 5 or more zombies and 2 or more skeletons.
The location is defined as usual. The number after the location is the range around the location in which will be checked for these entities. You can also specify additional `name:` argument,
with the name of the required entity. Replace all spaces with `_` here. You can use `marked:` argument to check only for entities marked in `spawn` event.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    entities ZOMBIE:2 100;200;300;world 10 name:Deamon
    ```

This condition allows you to resolve an expression containing variables, and the result will then be interpreted again as an condition.

```YAML title="Example"
events:
  simpleEval: eval chestitem -288;64;357;World emerald:5
  complexEval: eval point ranking 5 %objective.settings.equal% #(1)!
```

1. This could evaluate to `point ranking 5 equal` and will be true if the player has 5 points in the ranking category.
   But the variable could also be empty, and it could be higher or equal to 5. This is not possible in a normal condition.

## Experience: `experience`

This condition is met when the player has the specified amount of experience levels.
You can also define decimal numbers, for example `experience 1.5` will be met when the player has 1.5 or more experience levels.
If you want to check for an absolute amount of experience points you can convert it to decimal levels.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    experience 30
    experience 5.5
    ```

    ```

## Global point: `globalpoint` 

**persistent**, **static**

The same as point condition but it checks the amount for a global point category which has the same value for all players.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    globalpoint global_knownusers 100
    ```

## Global tag: `globaltag`

**persistent**, **static**

This requires a specific global tag to be set and works the same as normal tag condition.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    globaltag global_areNPCsAgressive
    ```

## Item in Hand: `hand`

This condition is met only when the player holds the specified quest item in their hand.
The offhand will be checked instead of the main hand if the `offhand` keyword is added.
Amount cannot be set here, though it may be checked with the `item` condition.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    hand SpecialSword
    hand QuestShield offhand
    ```

## Health: `health`

Requires the player to have equal or more health than specified amount. The only argument is a number (double). Players can have 0 to 20 health by default (there are some plugins and commands which change the maximum) (0 means dead, don't use that since it will only be met when the player sees the red respawn screen).

!!! example
    ```YAML
    health 5.6
    ```

## Height: `height`

This condition requires the player to be _below_ specific Y height. The required argument is a number or a location (for example 100;200;300;world). In case of location it will take the height from it and use it as regular height.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    height 16
    ```

## Hunger: `hunger`

## Item in Inventory: `item`

This condition requires the player to have all specified items in his inventory or backpack. You specify items in a list separated by commas (without spaces between!)

    ```

## Durability of item: `itemdurability`

This condition requires the player to have a certain amount of durability on an item.

4. Works the same as the `denizenVariable` with the only difference it checks for the player the condition is executed with.

## Weather: `weather`

**static**

There must be a specific weather for this condition to return true. There are three possible options: sun, rain and storm. Note that `/toggledownfall` does not change the weather, it just does what the name suggests: toggles downfall. The rain toggled off will still be considered as rain! Use `/weather clear` instead.
