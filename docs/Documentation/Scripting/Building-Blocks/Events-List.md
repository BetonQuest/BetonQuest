# Events List

@snippet:events:cancel@

## Burn: `burn`

| Parameter  | Syntax            | Default Value               | Explanation                                                        |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _duration_ | `duration:number` | :octicons-x-circle-16:      | The duration the player will burn (in seconds). Can be a variable. |

```YAML title="Example"
events:
  burn: "burn duration:4"
  punishing_fire: "burn duration:%point.punishment.amount%"
```

## Cancel the Conversation: `cancelconversation`

  Cancels the active conversation of the player.
  
```YAML title="Example"
  events:
    cancel: "cancelconversation"
```


## Chat player message `chat`

This event will send the given message as the player. Therefore, it will look like as if the player did send the message. 
The instruction string is the command, without leading slash. You can only use `%player%` as a variable in this event.
Additional messages can be defined by separating them with `|` character. If you want to use a `|` character in the message use `\|`.

If a plugin does not work with the sudo / command event you need to use this event.

!!! example
    ``` YAML
    sendMSG: "chat Hello!"
    sendMultipleMSGs: "chat Hi %player%|ban %player%|pardon %player%"
    sendPluginCommand: "chat /someCommand x y z"
    ```

## Chest Clear: `chestclear`
 
**persistent**, **static**

This event removes all items from a chest at specified location. The only argument is a location.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    chestclear 100;200;300;world
    ```

## Chest Give: `chestgive`

**persistent**, **static**

This works the same as `give` event, but it puts the items in a chest at specified location. The first argument is a location, the second argument is a list of items, like in `give` event. If the chest is full, the items will be dropped on the ground. The chest can be any other block with inventory, i.e. a hopper or a dispenser. BetonQuest will log an error to the console when this event is fired but there is no chest at specified location.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    chestgive 100;200;300;world emerald:5,sword
    ```

## Chest Take: `chesttake`
 
**persistent**, **static**

This event works the same as `take` event, but it takes items from a chest at specified location. The instruction string is defined in the same way as in `chestgive` event.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    chesttake 100;200;300;world emerald:5,sword
    ```

## Compass: `compass`

When you run this event, you can add or remove a compass destination for the player. You may also directly set the player's compass destination as well. When a destination is added the player will be able to select a specified location as a target of his compass. To select the target the player must open his backpack and click on the compass icon. The first argument is `add`,`del` or `set`, and second one is the name of the target, as defined in the _compass_ section. Note that if you set a target the player will not automatically have it added to their choices.

The destination must be defined in `compass` section. You can specify a name for the target in each language or just give a general name, and optionally add a custom item (from _items_ section) to be displayed in the backpack. Example of a compass target:

```YAML
compass:
  beton:
    name:
      en: Target
      pl: Cel
    location: 100;200;300;world
    item: scroll
```

!!! example
    ```YAML
    compass add beton
    ```

## Command: `command`

**persistent**, **static**

Runs specified command from the console. The instruction string is the command, without leading slash.
You can use variables here, but variables other than `%player%` won't resolve if the event is fired from delayed `folder`
and the player is offline now. You can define additional commands by separating them with `|` character.
If you want to use a `|` character in the command use `\|`.

Looking for [run command as player](#sudo-sudo)?

!!! example
    ```YAML
    command kill %player%|ban %player%
    ```

## Conversation: `conversation`

Starts a conversation at location of the player. 
The first argument is ID of the conversation. This bypasses the conversation permission!

The optional `option` argument is a NPC option where the conversation will start.
When using this argument the conversation will start without its header. 

!!! example
    ```YAML
    conversation village_smith
    conversation tutorial option:explain_world
    ```

## Damage player: `damage`

Damages the player by specified amount of damage. The only argument is a number (can have floating point).

!!! example
    ```YAML
    damage 20
    ```

## Delete Point: `deletepoint`

**persistent**, **static**

Clear all player points in a specified category.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    deletepoint npc_attitude
    ```
    
## Delete Globalpoint: `deleteglobalpoint`

**persistent**, **static**

Removes the specified category from the global points list.

```YAML
deleteBonus: "deleteglobalpoint bonus"
```

## Door: `door`

**persistent**, **static**

This event can open and close doors, trapdoors and fence gates. The syntax is exactly the same as in `lever` event above.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    door 100;200;300;world off
    ```

## Drop Item: `drop`

**static**

Drops the defined items at a defined location. The event takes two parameters: `items` and `location`.
Items is a list of [items](../../Features/Items.md) to be dropped.
Every item can optionally be followed by a colon to define an amount `<item>:<amount>` otherwise the amount is 1.
The optional location defines where the items will be dropped. It must be specified in the [unified location format](../Data-Formats.md#unified-location-formating).
If no location is given then the items will be dropped at the player's current location.

If the drop event is used in a schedule then the items will be dropped at the given location.
If no location is given then the items will be dropped for **every** player at their respective locations.

```YAML
drop items:magical_sword location:200;17;300;world
drop items:loot_rare,loot_common:3
drop items:myItem location:%objective.MyQuestVariables.DropLocation%
```

## Remove Potion Effect: `deleffect`

Removes the specified potion effects from the player. Use `any` instead of a list of types to remove all potion effects from the player.
Alternatively to `any`, you just can leave it blank.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    deleffect ABSORPTION,BLINDNESS
    deleffect any
    deleffect
    ```

## Potion Effect: `effect`

Adds a specified potion effect to player. First argument is potion type. You can find all available types [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html). Second is integer defining how long the effect will last in seconds. Third argument, also integer, defines level of the effect (1 means first level). Add a parameter `ambient` to make potion particles appear more invisible (just like beacon effects). To hide particles add a parameter `hidden`. To hide the icon for the effect add `noicon`.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    effect BLINDNESS 30 1 ambient icon
    ```
    
## Give experience: `experience`

This event allows you to manipulate player's experience. First you specify a number as the amount, then the modification action.
You can use `action:addExperience`, `action:addLevel`, `action:setExperienceBar` and `action:setLevel` as modification types.

To use this correctly, you need to understand this:

* A player has experience points.
* Experience levels, shown are shown as a number in the experience bar. Every level requires more experience points than the previous.  
* The experience bar itself shows the percentage of the experience points needed to reach the next level.

While `action:addExperience` only adds experience points, `action:addLevel` adds a level and keeps the current percentage.
`action:setExperienceBar` sets the progress of the bar. Decimal values between `0` and `1` represent the fill level.
This changes the underlying experience points, it's **not** just a visual change.
`action:setLevel` sets only the level, expect if you specify a decimal number, then the experience bar will be
set to the specified percentage.

```YAML title="Example"
add15XP: "experience 15 action:addExperience"
add4andAHalfLevel: "experience 4.5 action:addLevel"
remove2Level: "experience -2 action:addLevel"
setXPBar: "experience 0.5 action:setExperienceBar"
resetLevel: "experience 0.01 action:setLevel"
```

## Explosion: `explosion`

**persistent**, **static**

Creates an explosion. It can make fire and destroy blocks. You can also define power, so be careful not to blow your server away. Default TNT power is 4, while Wither on creation is 7. First argument can be 0 or 1 and states if explosion will generate fire (like Ghast's fireball). Second is also 0 or 1 but this defines if block will be destroyed or not. Third argument is the power (float number). At the end (4th attribute) there is location.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    explosion 0 1 4 100;64;-100;survival
    ```

## :material-folder-play: Run multiple events: `folder`

**persistent**, **static**

This event wraps multiple events inside itself. Once triggered, it simply executes it's events.
This is usefully to easily refer to a bunch of events at once, e.g. in a conversation.

Events marked as _persistent_ will be fired even after the player logs out.
Beware though, all conditions are false when the player is offline (even inverted ones),
so those events should not be blocked by any conditions!  
You can use the `cancelOnLogout` argument to stop the folder executing any remaining events if the player disconnects.


| Parameter          | Syntax                       | Default Value          | Explanation                                                                                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _events to run_    | eventName1,event2            | :octicons-x-circle-16: | One or multiple events to run. Contains event names seperated by commas.                        |
| _delay_            | Keyword                      | without delay          | The delay before the folder starts executing it's events.                                       |
| _period_           | period:number                | without delay          | The time between each event of the folder.                                                      |
| _time unit_        | Keyword                      | Seconds                | The unit of time to use for delay and period. Either `ticks` or `minutes`. Omit to use seconds. |
| _random_           | random:number                | Disabled               | Enables "random mode". Will randomly pick the defined amount of events .                        |
| _cancelOnLogout_   | Keyword                      | Disabled               | If enabled, the folder will stop executing events if the player disconnects.                    |
| _cancelConditions_ | cancelConditions:cond1,cond2 | Disabled               | If enabled, the folder will stop executing events if the conditions are true.                   |


```YAML title="Examples" 
events:
  simpleFolder: "folder event1,event2,event3" # (1)!
  runEvents: "folder event1,event2,event3 delay:5 period:1" # (2)!
  troll: "folder killPlayer,banPlayer,kickPlayer delay:5 random:1" # (3)!
  wait: "folder messagePlayer,giveReward delay:1 minutes" # (4)!
```

1. Runs all events after one tick with a delay of one tick between each event.
2. Runs `event1` after an initial delay of 5 seconds, then waits one second before executing each leftover event.
3. Randomly executes one of the three events after 5 seconds.
4. Executes the events after one minute.

## If-else through a list of events: `first`

This event wraps multiple events inside itself, similar `folder`. Unlike `folder`, it attempts to execute each event,
starting from the first onward. Once it successfully executes one event, it stops executing the rest. This is useful for
collapsing long if-else chains into single events.

This event is especially powerful when it is used in conjunction with the `condition:` keyword,
which can be used with any event.

```YAML title="Example"
events: # (1)!
  firstExample: "first event1,event2,event3"
  event1: "point carry boxes 10 action:add condition:firstCondition"
  event2: "point carry boxes 20 action:add condition:secondCondition"
  event3: "point carry boxes 40 action:add condition:thirdCondition"
```

1. If firstCondition is false, secondCondition is true, and thirdCondition is true, event2 is the only event that will
   be run.

```YAML title="Equivalent using if-else"
events:
  firstExample: "if firstCondition event1 else firstExample2"
  firstExample2: "if secondCondition event2 else firstExample3"
  firstExample3: "if thirdCondition event3"
  event1: "point carry boxes 10 action:add"
  event2: "point carry boxes 20 action:add"
  event3: "point carry boxes 40 action:add"
```

## Give Items: `give`

Gives the player predefined items. They are specified exactly as in `item` condition -
list separated by commas, every item can have amount separated by colon. Default amount is 1.
If the player doesn't have required space in the inventory, the items are dropped on the ground,
unless they are quest items. Then they will be put into the backpack. You can also specify `notify` keyword to display a
simple message to the player about receiving items.
The optional `backpack` argument forces quest items to be placed in the backpack.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    give emerald:5,emerald_block:9
    give important_sign notify backpack
    ```

## Give journal: `givejournal`

This event simply gives the player his journal. It acts the same way as **/j** command would.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    givejournal
    ```

## Global point: `globalpoint`

**persistent**, **static**

This works the same way as the normal [point event](#point-point) but instead to manipulating the points for a category of a specific 
player it manipulates points in a global category. These global categories are player independent, so you could for 
example add a point to such a global category every time a player does a quest and give some special rewards for 
the 100th player who does the quest.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    globalpoint global_knownusers 1 action:add
    globalpoint daily_login 0 action:set
    globalpoint reputaion 2 action:multiply
    ```

## Global tag: `globaltag`

**persistent**, **static**

Works the same way as a normal tag event, but instead of setting a tag for one player it sets it globally for all players.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    globaltag add global_areNPCsAgressive
    ```

## Hunger: `hunger`

This event changes the food level of the player. The second argument is the modification type.
There are `give`, `take` and `set`. The second argument is the amount. With `set` can the food level be anything.
If `give` or `take` is specified the final amount won't be more than 20 or less than 0.
If the hunger level is below 7, the player cannot sprint.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    hunger set 20
    hunger give 5
    ```

## If else: `if`

**persistent**, **static**

This event will check a condition, and based on the outcome it will run the first or second event. The instruction 
string is `if condition event1 else event2`, where `condition` is a condition ID and `event1` and `event2` are event IDs.
 `else` keyword is mandatory between events for no practical reason. Keep in mind that this event is `persistent` 
 and `static` but probably the condition or the events are not.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    if sun rain else sun
    ```

## Item durability: `itemdurability`

Adds or removes durability from an item in the slot.
The first argument is the slot, the second the change of durability and the third the amount.
Optional arguments are `ignoreUnbreakable` to ignore the unbreakable flag and unbreaking enchantment
and `ignoreEvents` to bypass event logic, so other plugins will not be able to interfere.
Available slot types: `HAND`, `OFF_HAND`, `HEAD`, `CHEST`, `LEGS`, `FEET`.

!!! info
    Both increasing and decreasing durability will be affected by the unbreaking enchantment.
    To prevent this behaviour use the `ignoreUnbreakable` argument.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    itemdurability HAND ADD 1
    itemdurability CHEST SUBTRACT %randomnumber.whole.15~30% ignoreUnbreakable ignoreEvents
    ```

## Journal: `journal`

**static**

Adds or deletes an entry to/from a player's journal. Journal entries have to be defined in the `journal` section. The
first argument is the action to perform, the second one is the name of the entry if required. Changing journal entries
will also reload the journal.

Possible actions are:
- `add`: Adds a page to the journal.
- `delete`: Deletes a page from the journal.
- `update`: Refreshes the journal. This is especially useful when you need to update the main page.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    journal add quest_started
    journal delete quest_available
    journal update
    ```

## Kill: `kill`

Kills the player. Nothing else.

## Language Event: `language`

**persistent**

This event changes player's language to the specified one. There is only one argument, the language name.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    language en
    ```

## Lever: `lever`

**persistent**, **static**

This event can switch a lever. The first argument is a location and the second one is state: `on`, `off` or `toggle`.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    lever 100;200;300;world toggle
    ```

## Lightning: `lightning`

**static**

Strikes a lightning at given location. The first argument is the location. By adding `noDamage` the lightning is only
an effect and therefor does no damage.

```YAML title="Examples" 
events:
  strikeLightning: lightning 100;64;-100;survival
  showEntrance: lightning 200;65;100;survival noDamage
```

@snippet:events:notify@

## Log message to console: `log`

**persistent**, **static**  

Prints a provided message to the server log. Any variables used in the message will be resolved. 
Note that when used in static context (by schedules) replacing player dependent variables won't work as the event is player independent.

| Parameter | Syntax           | Default Value | Explanation                                                                                                                               |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _level_   | `level:logLevel` | `INFO`        | Optionally the log level can be specified but only **before** the message. <br>There are 4 levels: `debug`, `info`, `warning` and `error` |

```YAML title="Example"
  events:
    logPlayer: "log %player% completed first quest."
    debug: "log level:DEBUG daily quests have been reset"
```

## Objective: `objective`

**persistent**, **static**

Adds, removes or completes the specified objective(s). 

| Parameter      | Syntax                             | Default Value          | Explanation                             |
|----------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| _action_       | Keyword: `add`,`remove`,`complete` | :octicons-x-circle-16: | The action to do with the objective(s). |
| _objective(s)_ | `objectiveName` or `obj1,obj2`     | :octicons-x-circle-16: | The objective(s) to run the action on.  |


Using this in static contexts only works when removing objectives!


```YAML
events:
  startQuest: "objective add killTheDragon,goToDungeon"
  progressQuest: "objective complete killTheDragon"
```

## OPsudo: `opsudo`

This event is similar to the `sudo` event, the only difference is that it will fire a command as the player with temporary OP permissions. 
Additional commands can be defined by separating them with `|` character. If you want to use a `|` character in the message use `\|`. Variables are supported.

Looking for [run as normal player](#sudo-sudo)?
Looking for [console commands](#command-command)?

!!! example
    ```YAML
    opsudo spawn
    ```

## Party event: `party`

This is part of the [party system](../Parties.md).
Runs the specified list of events (third argument) for every player in the party.
The last optional argument `amount` specifies a maximum number of players to select.
Selected players will be picked from the party if they are in range and meet the conditions.
Players are selected according to their distance from the player who triggered the event.
For example, if the 'amount' is two, the player who triggered the event and the player closest to that player will be selected.
A negative amount will select all players and therefore act as if there was no amount given.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    party 10 has_tag1,!has_tag2 give_reward
    party 10 has_tag1,!has_tag2 give_special_reward amount:3
    ```

## Pick random: `pickrandom`

**persistent**, **static**

Another container for events. It picks one (or multiple) of the given events and runs it.
You must specify how likely it is that each event is picked by adding the percentage before the event's id. 
The event won't break if your total percentages are above 100%. 

It picks one event from the list by default, but you can add an optional `amount:` if you want more to be picked.
Note that only as many events as specified can be picked and `amount:0` will do nothing.

There must be two `%%` before the event's name if variables are used, one is from the variable and the other one from the event's syntax.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    pickrandom 20.5%event1,0.5%event2,79%event3 amount:2
    pickrandom %point.factionXP.amount%%event1,0.5%event2,79%event3,1%event4 amount:3
    ```
    
## Point: `point`

**persistent**

This event allows you to manipulate player's points in a specified category. First you can specify a number of points, 
then the modification action. For that, you can use `action:add`, `action:subtract`, `action:set` and `action:multiply` 
as modification types. This event also supports an optional `notify` argument that will display information about the 
change using the notification system.

```YAML title="Example"
gainAttitude: "point npc_attitude 5 action:add"
loseAttitude: "point npc_attitude 2 action:subtract"
resetCombo: "point combo 0 action:set"
boostPoints: "point points 1.25 action:multiply notify"
```

## Remove entity: `removeentity`

**persistent**, **static**

Removes or kill all entities (mobs) of given type at the location. Here you can look up all [type's of entity's](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html).

Can only effect loaded entities!

| Parameter   | Syntax                                                                       | Default Value          | Explanation                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _entity(s)_ | `entity,entity`                                                              | :octicons-x-circle-16: | Required. List of entity's (separated by `,`).                                                                                              |
| _location_  | [Unified Location Formatting](../Data-Formats.md#unified-location-formating) | :octicons-x-circle-16: | Required. The center location of the target entity's.                                                                                       |

```


## Run events: `run`

**persistent**, **static**

This event allows you to specify multiple instructions in one, long instruction. Each instruction must be started
with the `^` character (it divides all the instructions). It's not the same as the `folder` event, because you have to
specify the actual instruction, not an event name.
Don't use conditions here, it behaves strangely.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    run ^tag add beton ^give emerald:5 ^entry add beton ^kill
    ```

## Run events for all online players: `runForAll`

**persistent**, **static**  

Runs the specified event (or list of events) once for each player on the server.  

The most common use case is to run an event for all online players from a [schedule](../Schedules.md).
But you can also use it in conversations, objectives or other events.

To run the events only for a selection of players, use the `where:` option to filter for players that meet specific conditions.

| Parameter | Syntax             | Default Value          | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _events_  | `events:events`    | :octicons-x-circle-16: | Required. The events to be run, separated by `,`.                                                                                                                                              |
| _where_   | `where:conditions` | :octicons-x-circle-16: | A list of optional conditions (separated by `,`) that are checked for every player. <br>The events supplied in `events:` are only executed for the players that meet all the given conditions. |


```YAML title="Example"
events:
    kickAll: "runForAll where:!isOp events:kickPlayer,restartQuest"
```

!!! warning
    You can still append conditions to the `runForAll` event (e.g. `runForAll events:kickPlayer conditions:!isOp`).  
    **This won't check the conditions for each player!**  
    Instead it will check the conditions for the player that triggered the event or check them player independent if triggered player independent (e.g. by a schedule).

## Run events player independent: `runIndependent`

**persistent**, **static**  

Runs the specified event (or list of events) player independent (as if it was run from a [schedule](../Schedules.md)).  

This is usefully for events that behave differently when run player independent.

??? abstract "Events that behave different if run player independent"
    * [`tag delete`](#tag-tag) - deletes the tag for all players in the database (even if offline)
    * [`objective remove`](#objective-objective) - removes the objective for all players in the database (even if offline)
    * [`journal delete`](#journal-journal) - deletes the journal entry for all players in the database (even if offline)
    * [`deletepoint`](#delete-point-deletepoint) - clears points of a given category for all players in the database (even if offline)

| Parameter | Syntax          | Default Value          | Explanation                                       |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| _events_  | `events:events` | :octicons-x-circle-16: | Required. The events to be run, separated by `,`. |

```YAML title="Example"
events:
    resetQuestForAll: "runIndependent events:removeObjective,clearTags,resetJournal"
```

!!! warning 
    There are a lot of events and conditions that cannot be run (or checked) player independent.  
    If you try to run such an event player independent (or check such a condition) this won't work, 
    and you will get an error message in the console.
    
    For more information on player independent events [check this](../Schedules.md#player-independent-events).

## Scoreboard: `score`

**persistent**

This event works in the same way as [point](#point-point), the only difference being that it uses scoreboards instead of 
points. You can use `action:add`, `action:subtract`, `action:set` and `action:multiply` to change the value.
It's only possible to change the value, you have to create the scoreboard target first.

```YAML title="Example"
gotKill: "score kill 1 action:add"
gotKilled: "score kill 1 action:subtract"
resetKill: "score kill 0 action:set"
applyBonus: "score kill 1.2 action:multiply"
```

## Scoreboard Tag: `scoretag`

This scoreboard event adds or remove the scoreboard tag from a player. The kind of tags that are used by vanilla Minecraft and not the [betonquest tags](#tag-tag).

| Parameter        | Syntax            | Default Value          | Explanation                       |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| _modifier_       | `add` or `remove` | :octicons-x-circle-16: | Whether to add or remove the tag. |
| _scoreboard tag_ | Tag name          | :octicons-x-circle-16: | The name of the scoreboard tag.   |

```YAML title="Example"
addVanillaTag: "scoretag add vanilla_tag"
removeVanillaTag: "scoretag remove vanilla_tag"
```

## Set Block: `setblock`

**persistent**, **static**

Changes the block at the given position.
The first argument is a [Block Selector](../Data-Formats.md#block-selectors), the second a location. It's possible to 
deactivate the physics of the block by adding `ignorePhysics` at the end.
Very powerful if used to trigger redstone contraptions.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    setblock REDSTONE_BLOCK 100;200;300;world
    setblock SAND 100;200;300;world ignorePhysics
    ```
    
## Modify Stage: `stage`
You can `set`, `increase` or `decrease` the player's stage. The objective will not automatically complete when using `set`.
By increasing it the player will be able to complete the objective. When increasing or decreasing the stage
you can optionally specify an amount to increase or decrease by.  
When decreasing the objective it will do nothing when the first stage is reached.  
When the conditions of the stage objective are not met, the stage of the player can not be modified.  
For more take a look at the [stage objective](./Objectives-List.md#stages-stage).

| Parameter         | Syntax                          | Default Value          | Explanation                                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| _stage objective_ | Objective                       | :octicons-x-circle-16: | The name of the stage objective                 |
| _action_          | `set`, `increase` or `decrease` | :octicons-x-circle-16: | The action to perform                           |
| _stage_           | Stage                           | :octicons-x-circle-16: | The name of the stage to set when `set` is used |
| _amount_          | Number                          | 1                      | The amount to increase or decrease by           |

```YAML title="Example"
events:
  setCookCookies: "stage bakeCookies set cookCookies"
  increase: "stage bakeCookies increase"
  decrease2: "stage bakeCookies decrease 2"
```

## Spawn Mob: `spawn`

**persistent**, **static**

Spawns specified amount of mobs of given type at the location. First argument is a location. Next is [type of the mob](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html). The last, third argument is integer for amount of mobs to be spawned. You can also specify `name:` argument, followed by the name of the mob. All `_` characters will be replaced with spaces. You can also mark the spawned mob with a keyword using `marked:` argument supporting variables. It won't show anywhere, and you can check for only marked mobs in `mobkill` objective.

You can specify armor which the mob will wear and items it will hold with `h:` (helmet), `c:` (chestplate), `l:` (leggings), `b:` (boots), `m:` (main hand) and `o:` (off hand) optional arguments. These take a single item without amount, as defined in the _items_ section. You can also add a list of drops with `drops:` argument, followed by a list of items with amounts after colons, separated by commas.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    spawn 100;200;300;world SKELETON 5 marked:targets
    ```

!!! example
    ```YAML
    spawn 100;200;300;world ZOMBIE name:Bolec 1 h:blue_hat c:red_vest drops:emerald:10,bread:2
    ```

## Sudo: `sudo`

This event is similar to `command` event, the only difference is that it will fire a command as the player (often referred to as player commands).
Additional commands can be defined by separating them with `|` character. If you want to use a `|` character in the message use `\|`. Variables are supported.

Looking for [run as op](#opsudo-opsudo)?
Looking for [console commands](#command-command)?

!!! example
    ```YAML
    sudo spawn
    ```

## Tag: `tag`

**persistent**, **static**

This event adds a tag to or deletes a tag from the player. The first argument after event's name must be
`add` or `delete`. Next goes the tag name. It can't contain spaces (though `_` is fine).
Multiple tags can be added and deleted separated by commas (without spaces).

!!! example
    ```YAML
    tag add quest_started,new_entry
    ```

## Take Items: `take`

Removes items from the player’s inventory, armor slots or backpack.
The items itself must be defined in the `items` section, optionally with an amount after a colon.
Which inventory types are checked is defined by the `invOrder:`
option. You can use `Backpack`, `Inventory`, `Offhand` and `Armor` there. One after another will be checked if multiple types are defined.

Note: If the items aren't quest items don't use `take`event with player options in conversations!
The player can drop items before selecting the option and pickup them after the event fires.
Validate it on the NPC’s reaction!

You can also specify `notify` keyword to display a simple message to the player about loosing items.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    take emerald:120,sword
    take nugget:6 notify
    take wand notify invOrder:Backpack
    take money:50 invOrder:Backpack,Inventory
    take armor invOrder:Armor,Offhand,Inventory,Backpack
    ```

## Time: `time`

**persistent**, **static**

Changes the time of the world. The time is represented in 24 hours format as a float number, so 0 is midnight, 12 is 
noon and 23 is 11 PM. For minutes, you can use floating point numbers, so 0.5 is half past midnight, 0.25 is quarter 
past midnight and so on. (0.1 hours is 6 minutes). It's possible to add or subtract time by using `+` or `-` prefix or 
to set the time by setting no prefix.
Additionally, you can specify the world in which the time will be changed, by adding `world:`.
Using the `ticks` argument changes the time like the vanilla command.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    time 6
    time +0.1
    time -12 world:rpgworld
    time +%randomnumber.whole.100~2000% world:pvpworld ticks
    ```

## :fontawesome-solid-person-walking-dashed-line-arrow-right: Teleport: `teleport`

Teleports the player to the specified location. 
Ends any active conversations. 

Do you only want to [cancel the conversation](#cancel-the-conversation-cancelconversation)?

| Parameter  | Syntax                                                                       | Default Value          | Explanation                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| _location_ | [Unified Location Formatting](../Data-Formats.md#unified-location-formating) | :octicons-x-circle-16: | The location to which the player will be teleported. |

```YAML title="Example"
events:
  toCity: "teleport 432;121;532;world" # (1)!
  toHell: "teleport 123;32;-789;world_the_nether;180;45" # (2)!
```

1. Teleports the player to X: 432, Y: 121, Z: 532 in the world named 'world'.
2. Teleports the player to X: 123, Y: 32, Z: -789 in the world named 'world_the_nether'. Also sets the head rotation to yaw 180 and pitch 45.

## Variable: `variable`

This event has only one purpose: Change values that are stored in `variable` objective variables. The first argument is
the ID of the `variable` objective. The second argument is the name of the variable to set. The third argument is the
value to set. Both the name and value can use `%...%` variables. To delete a variable you can use `""`.
To store more complex values you can use [quoting](../Quoting-&-YAML.md#quoting).
Refer to the [`variable` objective](Objectives-List.md#variable-variable) documentation for more information about storing variables.
This event will do nothing if the player does not already have a `variable` objective assigned to them.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    variable CustomVariable MyFirstVariable Goodbye!
    variable variable_objectiveID name %player%
    variable other_var_obj desc ""
    ```
    
## :fontawesome-solid-wind: Move the player: `velocity`

| Parameter      | Syntax                          | Default Value          | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _vector_       | `vector:(x;y;z)`                | :octicons-x-circle-16: | The values of the vector, which are decimal numbers, can be interpreted as absolute numbers like the coordinate or as relative directions. For more understanding the relative direction is similar to `^ ^ ^` in minecraft or in other words `(sideways;upwards;forwards)`. Can be a variable.                           |
| _direction_    | `direction:directionType`       | `absolute`             | There are 3 types how the vector can get applied to the player:<br> `absolute` won't change the vector at all.<br> `relative` will redirect the vector to the view of the player.<br> `relative_y` is a mix between absolute and relative. It will still direct to the view but only horizontally, so y will be absolute. |
| _modification_ | `modification:modificationType` | `set`                  | Possible modifications are `set` and `add`. The modification type determines how the vector should be merged with the player's velocity. The player's velocity is the external force applied on the player.                                                                                                               |

## :fontawesome-solid-cloud-sun-rain: Weather: `weather`

**persistent**, **static**  

Sets the weather in the world the player is currently in. The argument is `sun` for clear, sunny weather, `rain` for pure rain,
`storm` for storm with rain, lightning and thunder.
Durations less than 1 is equal to no duration.

| Parameter  | Syntax            | Default Value               | Explanation                                                                                                   |
