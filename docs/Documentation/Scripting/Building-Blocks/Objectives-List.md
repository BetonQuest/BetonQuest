# Objectives List

## Action: `action`

This objective completes when the player clicks on the given block type. 
It works great with the location condition and the item in hand condition to further limit the counted clicks.

    action any any conditions:holding_magicWand events:fireSpell #Custom click listener for a wand
    ```

<h5> Variable Properties </h5> 

The objective contains one property, `location`. It's a string formatted like `X: 100, Y: 200, Z:300`. It does not
show the radius.

## Arrow Shooting: `arrow`

To complete this objective the player needs to shoot the arrow into the target. There are two arguments, location of the
target and precision number (radius around location where the arrow must land, should be small). Note that the position
of an arrow after hit is on the wall of a _full_ block, which means that shooting not full blocks (like heads) won't
give accurate results. Experiment with this objective a bit to make sure you've set the numbers correctly.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    arrow 100.5;200.5;300.5;world 1.1 events:reward conditions:correct_player_position
    ```

## :material-pickaxe: Break or Place Blocks: `block`

To complete this objective the player must break or place the specified amount of blocks.

## Breed animals: `breed`

This objective is completed by breeding animals of specified type. The first argument is the
[animal type](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html) and the second argument is the

the animal is bred, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. While you can specify any entity, the
objective will be completable only for breedable ones.

This objective has three properties: `amount`, `left` and `total`. `amount` is the amount of animals already breed,

## Experience: `experience`

This objective can be completed by reaching the specified amount of experience levels.
You can also define decimal numbers, for example `experience 1.5` will complete when the player reaches 1.5 experience levels or more.
If you want to check for an absolute amount of experience points you can convert it to decimal levels.
The objective is checked every time the player gets experience naturally, such as killing mobs or mining blocks.
Additionally, it is checked if the player reaches a new level in any way (vanilla level up, commands or other plugins).
The objective will also imminently complete if the player already has the experience level or more.
And it will also be completed if the player joins the game with the specified amount of experience levels or more.
You can use the `notify` keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective,
optionally with the notification interval after a colon.

This objective has three properties: `amount`, `left` and `total`. `amount` is the current amount of experience levels,
`left` is the amount of experience levels still needed and `total` is the amount of experience required.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    experience 25 level events:reward
    ```

##:material-clock-time-two-outline: Wait: `delay` 

This objective completes itself after certain amount of time.
The player must be online and meet all conditions. If the player is not online the objective is completed on the player's
next login.

## Death: `die`

The death objective is completed when a player dies while fulfilling all conditions.
If you set the `respawn` location the player will spawn at that location, after pressing respawn,
and the objective will be completed then, not immediately on death.

Optionally you can also add the `cancel` argument to prevent the player from dying.
In this case, the player will be healed and all status effects will be removed.
You can also specify the `respawn` location to which the player will be teleported to.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    die respawn:100;200;300;world;90;0 events:respawned
    die cancel respawn:100;200;300;world;90;0 events:respawned
    ```

## :fontawesome-solid-fish-fins: Fishing: `fish`

## Resource pack state: `resourcepack`
**:fontawesome-solid-list-check:{.task} Objective  ·  :fontawesome-solid-paper-plane: Requires [Paper](https://papermc.io)**

To complete this objective the player must have the specified resource pack state.
The first argument is the state of the resource pack.
It can be `successfully_loaded`, `declined`, `failed_download` and `accepted`.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    resourcepack successfully_loaded events:reward
    resourcepack declined events:declined
    ```

## Kill player: `kill`

To complete this objective the player needs to kill another player. The first argument is amount of players to kill.
You can also specify additional arguments: `name:` followed by the name will only accept killing players with this name,
`required:` followed by a list of conditions separated with commas will only accept killing players meeting these conditions
and `notify` will display notifications when a player is killed, optionally with the notification interval after a colon.

The kill objective has three properties: `left` is the amount of players still left to kill, `amount` is the amount of
already killed players and `total` is the initially required amount to kill.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    kill 5 required:team_B
    ```

## Location: `location`

The specified location where the player needs to be.
It is not required to specify `entry` or `exit` then the objective also completes
if the player just moves inside the location's range.

| Parameter  | Syntax                                               | Default Value          | Explanation                                                                               |

!!! example
    ```YAML
    location 100;200;300;world 5 conditions:started events:notifyWelcome,start
    location 100;200;300;world 5 exit conditions:started events:notifyBye
    ```
<h5> Variable Properties </h5> 

| Name       | Example Output        | Explanation                              |
|------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| _location_ | X: 100, Y: 200, Z:300 | The target location of this objective    |

## Login: `login`

To complete this objective the player simply needs to login to the server.
If you use `global` this objective will be also completed directly when a new player joins for the first time.
If you use `persistent` it will be permanent.
Don't forget that if you use global and persistent you can still remove the objective explicitly.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    login events:welcome_message
    ```

## Logout: `logout`

To complete this objective the player simply needs to leave the server. Keep in mind that running a `folder` event here
will make it run in "persistent" mode, since the player is offline on the next tick.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    logout events:delete_objective
    ```

## NPC Interact: `npcinteract`

The player has to interact with a Npc. 

| Parameter     | Syntax              | Default Value          | Explanation                                                                         |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| _Cancel_      | `cancel`            | False                  | If the interaction with the Npc should be cancelled, so a conversation won't start. |
| _Interaction_ | interaction:Keyword | `right`                | The interaction type. Either `left`, `right` or `any`.                              |

```YAML title="Example"
stealItem: npcinteract mayor cancel conditions:sneak events:steal
punchThief: npcinteract thief interaction:left events:poke
```

## NPC Range: `npcrange`

The player has to enter/leave a circle with the given radius around the NPC to complete this objective.
It is also possible to define multiple NPCs separated with `,`.
The objective will be completed as soon as you meet the requirement of just one npc.

| Parameter | Syntax   | Default Value          | Explanation                                                          |
|-----------|----------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _Npcs_    | Npc List | :octicons-x-circle-16: | The IDs of the Npcs                                                  |
| _Action_  | Keyword  | :octicons-x-circle-16: | The required action. Either `enter`, `leave`, `inside` or `outside`. |
| _Range_   | Number   | :octicons-x-circle-16: | The maximum distance to a Npc                                        |

!!! info
    The types `enter`, `leave` force the player to actually enter the radius after you were outside of it and vice versa.
    This means that `enter` is not completed when the player gets the objective and is already in the range, while `inside` is instantly completed.

```YAML title="Example"
goToVillage: npcrange farmer,guard enter 20 events:master_inRange
```

## Password: `password`

This objective requires the player to write a certain password in chat. All attempts of a player will be hidden from public chat.
The password consists of a prefix followed by the actual secret word:
```
Solution: The Cake is a lie!     
^prefix   ^secret word(s)
```

The objective's instruction string is defined as follows:

1. The first argument is the password, use [quoting](../Quoting-&-YAML.md#quoting) for spaces
   The password is a [regular expression](../Data-Formats.md#regex-regular-expressions). 

2. The prefix can be changed: The default (when no prefix is set) is the translated prefix from the *messages.yml* config in the user's language.             
   Note that every custom prefix is suffixed with `:⠀`, so `prefix:Library_password` will require the user to enter `Library password: myfancypassword`.     
   To disable the prefix use an empty `prefix:` declaration, e.g. `password myfancypassword prefix: events:success`.
   Be aware of these side effects that come with disabling the prefix:
    
    * Nothing will be hidden on failure, so tries will be visible in chat and commands will get executed!
    * If a command was used to enter the password, the command will not be canceled on success and thus still be executed!    
    * This ensures that even if your password is `quest` you can still execute the `/quest` command. 
   
3. You can also add the `ignoreCase` argument if you want a password's capitalization to be ignored. This is especially important for regex matching.

4. If you want to trigger one or more events when the player failed to guess the password you can use the argument `fail` with a list of events (comma separated).
   With disabled prefix every command or chat message will trigger these events!


```YAML
objectives:
  theBetonPassword: 'password beton ignoreCase prefix:secret fail:failEvent1,failEvent2 events:message,reward'
  theBetonPasswordSpaced: 'password "beton quest" ignoreCase prefix:secret fail:failEvent1,failEvent2 events:message,reward'
```

## Pickup item: `pickup`

To complete this objective you need to pickup the specified amount of items. 
The first argument must be the internal name of an item defined in the `items` section. This can also be a comma-separated list of multiple items.
You can optionally add the `amount:` argument to specify how many of these items the player needs to pickup. 
This amount is a total amount though, it does not count per each individual item. You can use the `notify` keyword to
display a message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the notification interval after a colon.

You can also add the `notify` keyword to display how many items are left to pickup.

    ```YAML
    pickup emerald amount:3 events:reward notify
    pickup emerald,diamond amount:6 events:reward notify

name. The first, required argument is amount (integer). Optionally, you can add a `name:` argument to only count specific sheep.
If you want to use spaces use [quoting](../Quoting-&-YAML.md#quoting) syntax.
You can also check for the sheep's `color:` using these [color names](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/DyeColor.html).
You can use the `notify` keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective,
optionally with the notification interval after a colon.

This objective has three properties: `amount`, `left` and `total`. `amount` is the amount of sheep already sheared,
`left` is the amount of sheep still needed to shear and `total` is the amount of sheep initially required.

## Smelting: `smelt`

To complete this objective the player must smelt the specified item. Note that you must define the output item, not the
ingredient. The first argument is the name of a [Quest Item](../../Features/Items.md).

## Stages: `stage`
The Stage objective is a special objective that can be used to track the progress of a quest or a part of a quest.
It can be completed in two ways, the first one is by increasing the stage more than there are stages defined
and the second one is by completing the objective with the [objective event](./Events-List.md#objective-objective).
The behaviour of completing the objective by increasing the stage can be disabled by setting the `preventCompletion` flag.

When the conditions of the stage objective are not met, the stage of the player can not be modified.  
You can modify the stages with the [stage event](./Events-List.md#modify-stage-stage) and check it's state with the [stage condition](./Conditions-List.md#check-stage-stage).

| Parameter           | Syntax              | Default Value          | Explanation                                                          |

## Step on pressure plate: `step`

To complete this objective the player has to step on a pressure plate at a given location. The type of plate does not
matter. The first and only required argument is a location. If the pressure plate is not present at that location, the
objective will not be completable and will log errors in the console.

Step objective contains one property, `location`. It shows the exact location of the pressure plate in a string
formatted like `X: 100, Y: 200, Z:300`.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    step 100;200;300;world events:done
    ```

## Taming: `tame`

To complete this objective player must tame some amount of mobs. First argument is type, second is amount. The mob must
be tamable for the objective to be valid, e.g.: `CAT`, `DONKEY`, `HORSE`, `LLAMA`, `PARROT` or `WOLF`. You
can use the `notify` keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the
notification interval after a colon.

This objective has three properties: `amount`, `left` and `total`. `amount` is the amount of animals already tamed,
`left` is the amount of animals still needed to tame and `total` is the amount of animals initially required.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    tame WOLF 2 events:wolfs_tamed
    ```
   

## Player must Jump: `jump`
**:fontawesome-solid-list-check:{.task} Objective  ·  :fontawesome-solid-paper-plane: Requires [Paper](https://papermc.io)**

To complete this objective the player must jump. The only argument is amount. You can use the `notify` keyword to display a
message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the notification interval after a colon.

This objective has three properties: `amount`, `left` and `total`. `amount` is the amount of jumps already done,
`left` is the amount of jumps still needed and `total` is the amount of jumps initially required.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    jump 15 events:legExerciseDone
    ```

## Ride an entity: `ride`

This objective can be completed by riding the specified
[entity](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html).
`any` is also a valid input and matches any entity.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    ride horse
    ride any
    ```

## Run a Command: `command`

To complete this objective the player must execute a specified command. It can be both an existing or a new, custom
command. The first argument is the command text. To allow spaces use [quoting](../Quoting-&-YAML.md#quoting) syntax.
The command argument is case-sensitive and also supports using placeholders.
The second required argument is a list of events to execute when the objective ismet.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    command "/warp %player% farms" events:event1,event2
    command //replace_oak\_wood events:event1,event2
    ```

With this configuration, the command objective requires the player to execute `/warp MyName farms` to be completed. The
command objective matches from the start of the command that was executed, therefore if the player executed
`/warp MyName farms other arguments` it would still be completed.

Optional arguments:

* `ignoreCase`: If provided, instructs the objective to ignore case for the command to match.
* `exact`: If provided, requires an exact command match, not just the command start.
* `cancel`: If provided, the objective will cancel the execution of the command on a match. This needs to be enabled to suppress the `Unknown Command` message when using custom commands.
* `failEvents`: If provided, specifies a list of events to execute if a non-matching command is run and conditions are met.

!!! complex example
    ```YAML
    command "/warp %player% farms" ignoreCase exact cancel failEvents:failEvent1,failEvent2 events:event1,event2
    ```

## Equip Armor Item: `equip`
**:fontawesome-solid-list-check:{.task} Objective  ·  :fontawesome-solid-paper-plane: Requires [Paper](https://papermc.io)**

The player must equip the specified quest item in the specified slot.
The item must be any quest item as defined in the _items_ section.
Available slot types: `HEAD`, `CHEST`, `LEGS`, `FEET`.

```YAML
equip HEAD amazing_helmet events:event1,event2
equip CHEST amazing_armor events:event1,event2
```

## Variable: `variable`

This objective is different. You cannot complete it, it will also ignore defined events and conditions. You can start it and that's it.
While this objective is active though, everything the player types in chat (and matches a special pattern) will become a variable.
The pattern is `key: value`. So if the player types `MyFirstVariable: Hello!`, it will create a variable called `MyFirstVariable`, which will resolve as a `Hello!` string.
You can access them as objective properties. Let's say you defined this objective as `CustomVariable` in your _objectives.yml_ file.
You can access the variable in any conversation, event or condition with `%objective.CustomVariable.MyFirstVariable%` - and in the case of this example, it will resolve to `Hello!`.
The player can type something else and the variable will change its value. Variables are per-player, so the value of one player's `MyFirstVariable`
will be different from other players' `MyFirstVariable` values, depending on what they typed in chat. There is no limit to the amount of variables that can be created and assigned to players.
To remove this objective, use `objective delete` event - there is no other way.

You can also use `variable` event to change variables stored in this objective. There is one optional argument, `no-chat`. If you use it, the objective won't be modified 
by what players type in chat which is only useful when you're also using the `variable` event.

!!! example
    ```YAML
    variable
    ```
