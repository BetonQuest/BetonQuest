## Events
### Menu Event: `menu`
This event can be used to open, close or update menus.
The first argument is the type of action that should be done.
It is either `open` to open a new menu, `close` to close the currently opened menu, or `update` to update the 
content of the currently opened menu.  
If you want to open a menu you have to add a second argument which should be the id of a menu.
If you want to open menus from other packages just use the cross package format.
