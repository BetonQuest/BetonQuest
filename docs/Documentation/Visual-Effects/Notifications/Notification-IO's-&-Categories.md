A NotifyIO is a method of displaying a notification to the player. Here's a demo video showing an example configuration
of all NotifyIO's:

<video controls loop src="../../../../_media/content/Documentation/Notifications/NotifySystemOverview.mp4" width="100%">
  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>

Most NotifyIO's have unique settings that somehow change how a notification is displayed.    
**Additionally, they all allow any setting from the SoundIO to be used!**
This is because every NotifyIO has an internal SoundIO. 
Therefore, you can play a sound whenever a notification is shown.

The actual message is either defined in the event that triggers the NotifyIO or
in the *messages.yml* for all built-in notifications.

## Available NotifyIOs

There are a bunch of notify IOs available. They all have their own settings and are listed below.


### Chat
Writes the notification in the player's chat.

| Option          | Description                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| [Sound](#sound) | Any option from the [SoundIO](#sound). |

### Advancement
Shows the notification using an achievement popup.
Unfortunately, Minecraft will play the default advancement sound here. 
It's not possible to stop this sound from playingâ€”if you want to get rid of it, you would have to override / remove
that sound from your server's resource pack.
You can still add your own additional sound as usual though.
It will then be played together with the default advancement sound.

    </div>
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| barFlags | What [flags](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/boss/BarFlag.html) to add to the bossbar. `PLAY_BOSS_MUSIC` seems to be broken in either server or the game itself.
| barColor | What [color](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/boss/BarColor.html) to draw the bar. |

during the animation.

|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| customisation   | This CustomModelData will be used.     |
| [Sound](#sound) | Any option from the [SoundIO](#sound). |

### Sound
This IO just plays a sound. You can use its options in any other IO.
You should read the [wiki page](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands/playsound) of the playsound command
as Minecraft's sound system is kinda strange. Just one example: Sound never moves in Minecraft. It's totally static.
Keep that in mind when creating sounds close to a player. They can move around the sound and make it louder or quieter by walking towards / away from it.

| Option            | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sound             | Sound to play. If blank, no sound. Either vanilla Minecraft sounds (get them using /playsound autocompletion) or the name of a sound from a resource pack. |
| soundcategory     | The [category](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/SoundCategory.html) in which the sound will be played.                                  |
| soundvolume       | Minecraft's [special sound volume](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands/playsound#Arguments). Default: _1_                                                    |
| soundpitch        | Pitch of the sound. Default: _1_ Min: _0_ Max: _2_                                                                                                         |
| soundlocation     | Default: The player's location. A location using the BetonQuest [ULF](../../Scripting/Data-Formats.md#unified-location-formating). Can include variables.  |
| soundplayeroffset | This option is special. See below.                                                                                                                         |

<h3>soundplayeroffset:</h3>
This option can be a number or a vector.

**Number**:

The location the sound will be played at is moved away from the player towards the `soundlocation` using the value of
`soundplayeroffset`.
The sound will be at the actual location if the player is closer to the soundlocation
then the `soundplayeroffset` would allow.

??? info "Visual Explanation"  
    <div style="text-align: center">
    ![offset image](../../../_media/content/Documentation/Notifications/offset.png)
    </div>

    This shows how the sound will be played at the `soundlocation` if the `soundplayeroffset` is bigger then the current
    distance between the player and the `soundlocation` 
    <div style="text-align: center">
    ![offsetBiggerThanDistance image](../../../_media/content/Documentation/Notifications/offsetBiggerThanDistance.png)
    </div>

*Example usage*:

You could make a "sound compass" that will play a sound in the direction of a point of interest.

**Vector**:     
A vector has to be in the format`(x;y;z)`. This system will use the players relative coordinate system.
This means that the vectors x axis is right / left from the players head, the y axis is up or down from where ever the players face is
and the z axis is before / behind the players face. It will move along the players  head.

@snippet:general:relativeAxisExplanation@

This makes it possible to go crazy with sounds. Just one example: A Halloween special
where the player hears a :ghost: whispering into his left earâ€”no matter where he is or how he turns his head... ðŸŽƒ

Here is a small example:
??? info "Video Example"
    blue line = direction the player is looking in    
    ðŸŸ¢ = soundlocation argument    
    ðŸ”´  = the actual location the sound is played at    
    *soundplayeroffset = (0,0,5)*

    <video controls loop src="../../../../_media/content/Documentation/Notifications/RelativeVectorExample.mp4" width="100%">
      Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
    </video>
    The sound is always played 5 block away from the soundlocation. The direction is however based on where the player is looking.

### Suppress
Does not output any sound or text ðŸ”•. Can be used to remove built-in notifications.


## Categories

Notify Categories are pre-defined [NotifyIO settings](#categories). They can be applied to any notify event and are used
by BetonQuest's built-in notifications.
All categories must be defined in a section called `notifications`.

!!! warning
    **A note about the `notifications` section: BetonQuest searches through all packages and just uses the first one it finds.
    Therefore, you should probably create just one `notifications` section. We will improve this in BQ 2.0.**

### Custom Categories

Custom categories are user defined presets for any notify event. They shorten your events and enable you to change
how a notification of a certain category looks in one central place. They do not allow you to set a message though as 
the message is an argument of the notify event! 

This is how a custom category looks:
```YAML
notifications:
  money:            # Category name
   io: advancement  # Set's the used NotifyIO
   icon: gold_ingot # A setting of the bossbarIO
```

The only thing you must be careful with is the name of your custom categories. You could end up using a reserved name
- these stem from BetonQuest's build-in notification categories. Changing these is a [different feature](#built-in-categories).
A full list of all reserved names can be found below.

### Built-in Categories
The table below contains all build-in notification categories.

You may notice that the "Categories" column lists two categories.
These work exactly like the one in the `notify` event. The first existent category (from left to right) will be used.
This allows you to change all build-in notifications with just two entries in your *notifications* section:
```YAML
notifications:
  info:
    io: actionbar
  error:
    io: actionbar
``` 
You can override the settings from the info/error category for any specific notification by adding it to the 
`notifications` section. Example:
```YAML
notifications:
  info:
    io: actionbar
  error:
    io: actionbar
  new_journal_entry:  # The info categories settings are overridden for the new_journal_entry notification
    io: subtitle
```
