# Reference

This chapter describes all aspects of BetonQuest in one place. You should read it at least once to know what you're dealing with and where to search for information if you ever have any problems.

## Conditions, Events and Objectives

Conditions, events and objectives are defined with an "instruction string". It's a piece of text, formatted in a specific way, containing the instruction for the condition/event/objective. Thanks to this string they know what should they do. To define the instruction string you will need a reference, few pages below. It describes how something behaves and how it should be created. All instruction strings are defined in appropriate sections, for example all conditions are in the _conditions_ section. The syntax used to define them looks like this: `name: 'the instruction string containing the data'`. Apostrophes are optional in most cases, you can find out when to use them by looking up "YAML syntax" in Google.

### Conditions

Conditions are the most versatile and useful tools in creating advanced quests. They allow you to control what options are available to player in conversations, how the NPC responds or if the objective will be completed. The reference of all possible conditions is down below.

You can negate the condition (revert its output) by adding an exclamation mark (`!`) at the beginning of it's name (in the place you use it, i.e. in conversations, not in the _conditions_ section).

You can use conversation variables instead of numeric arguments in conditions. If the variable fails to resolve (i.e. it will return an empty string) BetonQuest will use 0 instead.

### Events

In certain moments you will want something to happen. Updating the journal, setting tags, giving rewards, all these are done using events. You define them just like conditions, by specifying a name and instruction string. You can find instruction strings to all events in the event reference. At the end of the instruction string you can add `conditions:` or `condition:` (with or without `s` at the end) attribute followed by a list of condition names separated by commas, like `conditions:angry,!quest_started`. This will make an event fire only when these conditions are met.

You can use conversation variables instead of numeric arguments in events. If the variable fails to resolve (i.e. it will return an empty string) BetonQuest will use 0 instead.

### Objectives

Objectives are the main things you will use when creating complex quests. You start them with a special
event, `objective`. You define them in the _objectives.yml_ file, just as you would conditions or events. At the end of
the instruction string you can add conditions and events for the objective. Conditions will limit when the objective can
be completed (e.g. killing zombies only at given location in quest for defending city gates), and events will fire when
the objective is completed (e.g. giving a reward, or setting a tag which will enable collecting a reward from an NPC).
You define these like that: `conditions:con1,con2 events:event1,event2` at the end of instruction string . Separate them
by commas and never use spaces! You can also use singular forms of these arguments: `condition:` and `event:`.

If you want to start an objective right after it was completed (for example `die` objective: when you die, teleport you
to a special spawnpoint and start `die` objective again), you can add `persistent` argument at the end of an instruction
string. It will prevent the objective from being completed, although it will run all its events. To cancel such
objective you will need to use `objective delete` event.

Objectives are loaded at start-up, but they do not consume resources without player actually having them active. This
means that if you have 100 objectives defined, and 20 players doing one objective, 20 another players doing second
objective, and the rest objectives are inactive (no one does them), then only 2 objectives will be consuming your server
resources, not 100, not 40.

## :octicons-location-16: Unified location formating

Whenever you want to define some location in your events, conditions, objectives or any other things, you will define it
with this specific format. The location consists of 2 things: base and vector. Only the base is always required.

### Base Location
The base is a core location. There are two types: absolute coordinates and variables. Absolute coordinates are
defined like `100;200;300;world`, where `100` is X coordinate, `200` is Y, `300` is Z and `world` is the name of the
world. These can have decimal values. If you want you can also add two more numbers at the end, yaw and pitch 
(these are controlling the rotation, for example in teleportation event, both are needed if you decide to add them;
example: `0.5;64;0.5;world;90;-270`).

### Variables as Base Location
To use a variable as the location's base it must resolve to valid absolute coordinates. An example of such variable 
is `%location%`, which shows player's exact location. Simply place it instead of coordinates. There is one rule though:
you can't use variable base types in events running without players (for example static events or the ones run from
folder event after the player left the server). BetonQuest won't be able to resolve the location variable without the
player!

### Vectors
The vector is a modification of the location. Vectors look like `->(10;2.5;-13)` and are added
to the end of the base. This will modify the location, X by 10, Y by 2.5 and Z by -13. For example, location written as
`100;200;300;world_nether->(10;2.5;-13)` will generate a location with X=110, Y=202.5 and Z=287 in the world `world_nether`.

## Global variables

You can insert a global variable in any instruction string. It looks like this: `$beton$` (and this one would be
called "beton"). When the plugin loads that instruction string it will replace those variables with values assigned to
them in _package.yml_ file **before** the instruction string is parsed. This is useful for example when installing a
package containing a WorldEdit schematic of the quest building. Instead of going through the whole code to set those
locations, names or texts you will only have to specify a few variables (that is, of course, if the author of the
package used those variables properly in his code).

Note that these variables are something entirely different than conversation variables. Global ones use `$` characters
and conversation ones use `%` characters. The former is resolved before the instruction string is parsed while the
latter is resolved when the quests are running, usually on a per-player basis.

```YAML
variables:
  village_location: 100;200;300;world
  village_name: Concrete
```

## Canceling quests

If you want to let your players cancel their quest there is a function for that. In _package.yml_ file there is `cancel`
branch. You can specify there quests, which can be canceled, as well as actions that need to be done to actually cancel
them. The arguments you can specify are:

* `name` - this will be the name displayed to the player. All `_` characters will be converted to spaces. If you want to include other languages you can add here additional options (`en` for English etc.)
* `conditions` - this is a list of conditions separated by commas. The player needs to meet all those conditions to be able to cancel this quest. Place there the ones which detect that the player has started the quest, but he has not finished it yet. 
* `objectives` - list of all objectives used in this quest. They will be canceled without firing their events.
* `tags` - this is a list of tags that will be deleted. Place here all tags that you use during the quest.
* `points` - list of all categories that will be entirely deleted.
* `journal` - these journal entries will be deleted when canceling the quest.
* `events` - if you want to do something else when canceling the quest (like punishing the player), list the events here.
* `loc` - this is a location to which the player will be teleported when canceling the quest (defined as in teleport event);

To cancel the quest you need to open your backpack and select a "cancel" button. There will be a list of quests which can be canceled. Just select the one that interests you and it will be canceled.

## Global objectives

If you want a objective to be active for every player right after joining you can create a global objective. This is done by adding `global` argument to the instruction of the objective. When you then reload BetonQuest it is started for all online players and also will be started for every player who joins.

To prevent the objective from being started every time a player joins a tag is set for the player whenever the objective is started and as long as the player has the tag the objective wont be started again if the player joins.  
These tags follow syntax `<package>.global-<id>`, where `<id>` is the objectives id and `<package>` the package where the objective is located.

Possible use cases would be a quest which starts if a player reaches a specific location or breaks a specific block.

**Example:**
```YAML
start_quest_mine: 'location 100;200;300;world 5 events:start_quest_mine_folder global'
```

## Journal

The journal is a book in which all your adventures are described. You can obtain it by typing **/j** command or **/b** and selecting it from backpack. You cannot put it into any chests, item frames and so on. If you ever feel the need to get rid of your journal, just drop it - it will return to your backpack. The journal is updated with the `journal` event, and the text inside is defined in the _journal_ section. If you update these texts and reload the plugin, all players' journals will reflect changes. Colors in the journal can be altered in config.yml. The entries can use color codes, but the color will be lost between pages.

The journal by default appears in the last slot of the hotbar. If you want to change that use `default_journal_slot` option in _config.yml_, experiment with different settings until you're ok with it.

If you want to translate the entry do the same thing as with conversation option - go to new line, add language ID and the journal text for every language you want to include.

You can control behavior of the journal in _config.yml_ file, in `journal` section. `chars_per_page` specifies how many characters will be placed on a single page. If you set it too high, the text will overflow outside of the page, too low, there will be too much pages. `one_entry_per_page` allows you to place every entry on a single page. The `chars_per_page` setting is in this case ignored, BetonQuest will put entire entry on that page. `reversed_order` allows you to reverse order of entries and `hide_date` lets you remove the date from journal entries.

You can control colors in the journal in `journal_colors` section in _config.yml_: `date` is a color of date of every
entry, `line` is a color of lines separating entries and `text` is just a color of a text. You need to use standard
color codes without `&` (eg. `'4'` for dark red).

You can also add a main page to the journal. It's a list of texts, which will show only if specified conditions are met.
You can define them in the _package.yml_ file, in the `journal_main_page` section:

```YAML
journal_main_page:
  title:
    priority: 1
    text:
      en: '&eThe Journal'
      pl: '&eDziennik'
    conditions: 'quest_started,!quest_completed'
```

Each string can have text in different languages, list of conditions separated by commas (these must be met for the text to show in the journal) and `priority`, which controls the order of texts. You can use conversation variables in the texts, but they will only be updated when the player gets his journal with the **/journal** command. Color codes are supported.

If you want your main page take a separate page (so entries will be displayed on next free page), set `full_main_page` in _config.yml_ to "true".
If you want to manually wrap the page, use the pipe `|` character. Use \n to go to a new line.

## Tags

Tags are little pieces of text you can assign to player and then check if he has them. They are particularly useful to determine if player has started or completed quest. They are given with `tag` event and checked with `tag` condition. All tags are bound to a package, so if you add `beton` tag from within a package named `example`, the tag will look like `example.beton`. If you're checking for `beton` tag from within `example` package, you're actually checking for `example.beton`. If you want to check a tag from another package, then you just need to prefix it's name with that package, for example `quest.beton`.

## Points

Points are like tags, but with amount. You can earn them for doing quest, talking with NPC’s, basically for everything you want. You can also take the points away, even to negative numbers. Points can be divided to categories, so the ones from _beton_ category won’t mix with points from _quests_ group. Of course then you can check if player has (or doesn't have) certain amount and do something based on this condition. They can be used as counter for specific number of quest done, as a reputation system in villages and even NPC’s attitude to player.

## NPCs

Conversations can be assigned to NPCs created with Citizens. You do it in the `npcs` section:

```YAML
npcs:
  '0': innkeeper
  '4': woodcutter
```

The first string is the ID of the NPC (_don't try to put Citizens NPC's name here, it must be the ID_), second one is
the corresponding conversation name as defined in the `conversations` section. To acquire the NPCs ID select the NPC and type
`/npc` or `/npc id`. 

You can assign the same conversation to multiple NPCs.

!!! note
    The Citizens ID must be enclosed in quotes.

## Items

Items in BetonQuest are defined in the _items_ section. Each item has an instruction string, similarly to events, conditions etc. Basic syntax is very simple:

```YAML
item: BLOCK_SELECTOR other arguments...
```

[BLOCK_SELECTOR](#block-selectors) is a type of the item. It doesn't have to be all in uppercase. Other arguments specify data like name of the item, lore, enchantments or potion effects. There are two categories of these arguments: the ones you can apply to every item and type specific arguments. Examples would be name (for every item type) and text (only in books).

Every argument is used in two ways: when creating an item and when checking if some existing item matches the instruction. The first case is pretty straightforward - BetonQuest takes all data you specified and creates an item, simple as that. Second case is more complicated. You can require some property of the item to exist, other not to exist, or skip this property check altogether. You can also accept an item only if some value (like enchantment level) is greater/less than _x_. You can use wildcards in the BLOCK_SELECTOR to match multiple types of items.

These are arguments that can be applied to every item:

- `name` - the display name of the item. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use `&` color codes. If you want to specifically say that the item must not have any name, use `none` keyword.

- `lore` - text under the item's name. Default styling of lore is purple and italic. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use `&` color codes. To make a new line use `;` character. If you require the item not to have lore at all, use `none` keyword. By default lore will match only if all lines are exactly the same. If you want to accept all items which contain specified lines (and/or more lines), add `lore-containing` argument to the instruction string.

- `enchants` - a list of enchantments and their levels. Each enchantment consists of these things, separated by colons:
    - [name](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html)
    - level (a positive number)
    
    For example `damage_all:3` is _Sharpness III_. You can specify additional enchantments by separating them with commas.
    
    You can require the item not to have any enchantments by using `none` keyword. You can also add `+`/`-` character to the enchantment level to make the check require levels greater/less (and equal) than specified. If you don't care about the level, replace the number with a question mark.
    
    By default, all specified enchantments are required. If you want to check if the item contains a matching enchantment (and/or more enchants), add `enchants-containing` argument to the instruction string. Each specified enchantment will be required on the item by default unless you prefix its name with `none-`, for example `none-knockback` means that the item must not have any knockback enchantment. **Do not use `none-` prefix unless you're using `enchants-containing` argument**, it doesn't make any sense and will break the check!

- `unbreakable` - this makes the item unbreakable. You can specify it either as `unbreakable` or `unbreakable:true` to require an item to be unbreakable. If you want to check if the item is breakable, use `unbreakable:false`.

- `custom-model-data` - set the custom model data of the item. You have to specify the data value: `custom-model-data:3`. To check that an item does not have custom model data set `no-custom-model-data`.

**Examples**:

```YAML
name:&4Sword_made_of_Holy_Concrete
name:none
lore:&cOnly_this_sword_can_kill_the_Lord_Ruler
lore:&2Quest_Item lore-containing
lore:none
enchants:damage_all:3+,none-knockback
enchants:power:? enchants-containing
enchants:none
unbreakable
unbreakable:false
```

These are the arguments that can be applied only to specific item types:

### Books

_This applies to a written book and a book and quill._

- `title` - the title of a book. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use `&` color codes. If you want to specifically say that the book must not have any title, use `none` keyword.

- `author` - the author of a book. All underscores will be replaced with spaces, you cannot use color codes here. If you want to specifically say that the book must not have any author, use `none` keyword.

- `text` - the text of the book. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use `&` color codes. The text will wrap to the next page if amount of characters exceeds `journal.chars_per_page` setting in _config.yml_. If you want to manually wrap the page, use `|` character. To go to new line use `\n`. Keep in mind that you can't use any spaces here, you must only use underscores (`_`). This needs to be a single argument, even if it's really long. If you don't want the book to have any text, use `none` keyword instead.

**Examples**:

```YAML
title:Malleus_Maleficarum
author:&eGallus_Anonymus
text:Lorem_ipsum_dolor_sit_amet,\nconsectetur_adipiscing_elit.|Pellentesque_ligula_urna(...)
```

### Potions

_This applies to potions, splash potions and lingering potions._

- `type` - type of a potion. Here's [the list](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionType.html) of possible types. Do not mistake this for a custom effect, this argument corresponds to the default vanilla potion types.

- `extended` - extended property of the potion (you can achieve it in-game by adding redstone). It can be specified as `extended` or `extended:true`. If you want to check the potion that is NOT extended, use `extended:false`.

- `upgraded` - upgraded property of the potion (you can achieve it in-game by adding glowstone). It can be specified as `upgraded` or `upgraded:true`. If you want to check the potion that is NOT upgraded, use `upgraded:false`.

- `effects` - a list of custom effects. These are independent of the potion type. The effects must be separated by commas. Each effect consists of these things, separated by colons:

    - [type](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html) (this is different stuff that the link above!)
    - power
    - duration (in seconds)
    
    An example would be `WITHER:2:30`, which is a wither effect of level 2 for 30 seconds.

    If you want to target only potions without custom effects, use `none` keyword. You can target potions with level and time greater/less (and equal) than specified with `+`/`-` character after the number. If you don't care about the level/time, you can replace them with question mark.
    
    By default, all specified effects are required. If you want to check if the potion contains these effects among others, add `effects-containing` argument to the instruction string. Now if you want to make sure the potion doesn't contain a specific effect, prefix the effect name with `none-`. **Don't use that prefix unless you're also using `effects-containing` argument**, it doesn't make any sense and it will break the check.

**Examples**:

```YAML
type:instant_heal
extended
upgraded:false
effects:poison:1+:?,slow:?:45-
effects:none-weakness,invisibility:?:? effects-containing
```

### Heads

_This applies to human heads._

- `owner` - this is the name of the head owner. It will **not** use color codes nor replace underscores with spaces. If you want to check for heads without any owner, use `none` keyword.

**Examples**:

```YAML
owner:Co0sh
owner:none
```

### Leather armor

_This applies to all parts of leather armor._

- `color` - this is the color of the armor piece. It can be either one of [these values](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/DyeColor.html), a hexadecimal RGB value prefixed with `#` character or its decimal representation without the prefix. You can also check if the armor piece doesn't have any color with `none` keyword.

**Examples**:

```YAML
color:light_blue
color:#ff00ff
color:none
```

### Fireworks

_This applies to fireworks._

- `firework` - this is a list of effects of the firework rocket. They are separated by commas. Each effect consists of these things separated by colons:

    - [effect type](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/FireworkEffect.Type.html)
    - a list of main colors (refer to leather armor colors above for syntax) separated by semicolons
    - a list of fade colors
    - `true`/`false` keyword for trail effect
    - `true`/`false` keyword for flicker.

    Note the separation characters, this is important: commas separate effects, colons separate effect properties, semicolons separate colors.
    
    If you want to target fireworks without any effects, use `none` keyword. If you want to target any effect type, use question mark instead of the effect name. If you don't want the effect to have any main/fade colors, use `none` keyword in the place of colors. If you don't care about main/fade colors, use question marks in that place. If you don't care about trail/flicker effect, use question marks instead of `true`/`false` keyword.
    
    By default, the check will require all specified effects to be present on the firework. You can check if the firework contains specified effects among others by adding `firework-containing` argument to the instruction string. To match the item which must not have an effect, prefix the effect name with `none-` keyword. **Don't use that prefix unless you're also using `firework-containing` argument**, it doesn't make any sense and will break the check.

- `power` - flight duration of the firework, in levels. You can use `+`/`-` character to target greater/less (and equal) levels.

**Examples**:

```YAML
firework:ball:red;white:green;blue:true:true,ball_large:green;yellow:pink;black:false:false
firework:burst:?:none:?:? firework-containing
firework:none-creeper firework-containing
firework:none
power:3
power:2+
```

### Firework charges

_This applies to firework charges._

- `firework` - this is almost the same as fireworks. You can only specify a single effect and the `power` argument has no effects.

## Backpack

Sometimes you'll want some items to be persistent over death. The quest could be broken if the player loses them.
Such an item wouldn't be dropped (on death), instead it would be placed in the player's backpack.

You can add a specific line to an item's lore to make it persistent. It's `&2Quest_Item` (`_` is a space in an item's definition) if your default language is english.
The translation of the line can be found in *messages.yml* if a different default language is configured. It's also possible to change the translation. 

Note that this must be an entirely new line in the lore!    
**Example**:
```YAML 
important_sword: "DIAMOND_SWORD name:Sword_for_destroying__The_Concrete lore:Made_of_pure_Mithril;&2Quest_Item"
```

The backpack can be opened with the **/backpack** command. The inventory window will open, displaying your stored items. The first slot is always the journal, and if you get it, the slot will stay empty. You can transfer quest items back and forth between inventories by clicking on them. Left click will transfer just one item, right click will try to transfer all items. Normal items cannot be stored into the backpack, so it's not an infinite inventory.

If you will ever have more than one page of quest items, the buttons will appear. You can customize those buttons by creating `previous_button` and `next_button` items in the _items_ section. Their name will be overwritten with the one defined in _messages.yml_.

Quest items cannot be dropped in any way other than using them. This way you can create a quest for eating cookies by giving the player a stack of cookies flagged as quest items and not continuing until there are no more cookies in his inventory/backpack. The player cannot drop the cookies, so he must eat every one of them to complete the quest.

Don't worry if the item-dropping filter isn't working for your items when you're in creative mode - it's not a bug. It's a feature. Creative-mode players should be able to easily put quest items in containers like TreasureChests.

## Party

Parties are very simple. So simple, that they are hard to understand if you already know some other party system. Basically, they don't even have to be created before using them. Parties are defined directly in conditions/events (`party` event, `party` conditions, check them out in the reference lists below). In such instruction strings the first argument is a number - range. It defines the radius where the party members will be looked for. Second is a list of conditions. Only the players that meet those conditions will be considered as members of the party. It's most intuitive for players, as they don't have to do anything to be in a party - no commands, no GUIs, just starting the same quest or having the same item - you choose what and when makes the party.

To understand better how it works I will show you an example of `party` event. Let's say that every player has an objective of pressing a button. When one of them presses it, this event is fired:

```YAML
party_reward: party 50 quest_started cancel_button,teleport_to_dungeon
```

Now, it means that all players that: are in radius of 50 blocks around the player who pressed the button AND meet `quest_started` condition will receive `cancel_button` and `teleport_to_dungeon` events. The first one will cancel the quest for pressing the button for the others (it's no longer needed), the second one will teleport them somewhere. Now, imagine there is a player on the other side of the world who also meets `quest_started` condition - he won't be teleported into the dungeon, because he was not with the other players (not in 50 blocks range). Now, there were a bunch of other players running around the button, but they didn't meet the `quest_started` condition. They also won't be teleported (they didn't start this quest).

## Block Selectors

When specifying a way of matching a block, a `block selector` is used.

### Format

The format of a block selector is: `namespace:material[state=value,...]`

Where:

  - `namespace` - (optional) The material namespace. If left out then it will be assumed to be 'minecraft'.
   Can be a [regex](#regex-regular-expressions).
  
  - `material` - The material the block is made of. All materials can be found in
  [Spigots Javadocs](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html). 
  It can be a [regex](#regex-regular-expressions).
  If the regex ends with square brackets you have to add another pair of empty square brackets even if you don't want to 
  use the state argument (`[regex][]`).  
  Instead of using a regex to match multiple materials you can also define a [tag](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag).
  Every tag matches a special group of blocks or items that can be grouped together logically. They can be used using this format `:blocks:flowers` or `minecraft:blocks:flowers`.
  Be aware that a tag always starts with either `:` or a namespace. 
  
  - `state` - (optional) The block states can be provided in a comma separated `key=value` list surrounded by square brackets.
   You can look up states in the Minecraft [wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Block_states).
   Any states left out will be ignored when matching.
   *Values* can be a [regex](#regex-regular-expressions).

Examples:

  - `minecraft:stone` - Matches all blocks of type STONE
  
  - `redstone_wire` - Matches all blocks of type REDSTONE_WIRE
  
  - `redstone_wire[power=5]` - Matches all blocks of type REDSTONE_WIRE and which have a power of 5
  
  - `redstone_wire[power=5,facing=1]` - Matches all blocks of type REDSTONE_WIRE and which have both a power of 5 and are facing 1
  
  - `.*_LOG` - Matches all LOGS
  
  - `.*` - Matches everything
  
  - `.*[waterlogged=true]` - Matches all waterlogged blocks
  
  - `minecraft:blocks:flowers` - Matches all flowers
  
  - `:blocks:crops[age=0]` - Matches all crops with an age of 0 meaning, not grown / just planted

### Setting behaviour

A block selector with a regex or tag as it's material name results in a random block out of all blocks that match that regex or tag.
You cannot use a regex in block states when the block selector is used for placing blocks.

### Matching behaviour

The block state will ignore all additional block states on the block it's compared with by default.
Example: `fence[facing=north] matches fence[facing=north] and fence[facing=north,waterlogged=true]`
You can add an `exactMatch` argument if you only want to match blocks that exactly match the block state. 
A regex is allowed in any block state value when the block selector is used to match blocks.

## Hiding Players

<video controls loop src="../../_media/content/Documentation/Compatibility/PlayerHider.mp4" width="100%">
  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>

You can also hide players for specific players in the `player_hider` section of your package. When the `source_player` meets the conditions,
every player that meets the `target_player` conditions will be completely hidden from them. 
This is really useful if you want a lonely place on your server 
or your quests break when multiple players can see or affect each other.
You can configure the interval which checks the conditions in the [config.yml](./Configuration.md#player-hider-interval).

Special behaviour:

* A player that meets the `source_player`conditions can no longer be pushed by other players.
* By leaving the e.g. `source_player` argument empty it will match all players.

```YAML
player_hider:
  example_hider:  #All players in a special region cannot see any other players in that region. If a player is outside the region, they can still see the `target_player`.
    source_player: in_StoryRegion
    target_player: in_StoryRegion
  another_hider: #No one can see any players inside a secret room.
    #The source_player argument is left out to match all players.    
    target_player: in_secretRoom
  empty_hider: #in_Lobby is a world condition. Therefore, the lobby world appears empty for everyone that is in it.
    source_player: in_Lobby
    #The target_player argument is left out to match all players.
```

## Regex (Regular Expressions)
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern for text. It's used in BetonQuest to
check if game objects match a user-defined input. For example, [Block Selectors](#block-selectors) use a regex to match
multiple materials or block states. You can also use regular expressions in the 
[variable condition](Conditions-List.md#variable-variable) or the 
[password objective](Objectives-List.md#password-password) to match player names, item names, etc. These expressions are
a very powerful tool, but can be confusing at first.

### Common Use Cases

| Use Case                                                      | Regex                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| A specific text e.g. `STONE`                                  | `STONE`                |
| A text starting with `STONE`                                  | `STONE.*`              |
| A text ending with `_LOG`                                     | `.*_LOG`               |
| A specific number e.g. `42`                                   | `^42$`                 |
| A specific range of numbers, e.g. any number between 0 and 99 | `[0-9]{1,2}`           |
| Positive numbers only                                         | `^\d+$`                |
| Negative numbers only                                         | `^-\d+$`               |
| Any number                                                    | `[-+]?[0-9]+\.?[0-9]+` |

### More complex use cases

If you want to use complex patterns you must learn more about regular expressions. There are countless resources online,
