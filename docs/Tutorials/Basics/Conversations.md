##Creating the folder the first quest

Let's start with creating new folders for this tutorial. First create a ```tutorialQuest``` folder and inside this
folder create another folder named ```conversations``` this is helpful to separate things.
Now we have to create two more files. The first file is called ```package.yml``` and this goes into the ```tutorialQuest``` folder.
The second one is called ```jack.yml``` and goes to the ```conversations``` folder.
After creating the folders/files your structure should look like this:

:material-chevron-down: tutorialQuest
    :material-chevron-down: conversations
        - jack.yml
    - package.yml
