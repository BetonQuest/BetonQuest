# :material-hand-wave: Welcome to the Tutorials
Thanks for using BetonQuest! The plugin has tons of features and therefore requires some learning.
This documentation provides you with a large number of high quality tutorials that will make you a great quest writer.

However, help is not far if you get stuck. We have a
<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/rK6mfHq" target="_blank">Community Discord :fontawesome-brands-discord:</a> for questions.

[:material-cog-play: Start the Tutorial Setup](Getting-Started/Setup-Guide/Setting-up-a-test-server.md){ .md-button } 
!!! caution "Work in Progress! :construction: :construction_worker:  :construction_site:"

    **The tutorials are currently getting redesigned.**
    
    Therefore, the "Basic" section does not actually contain all basics yet. 
    
    - [X] Conversations
    - [X] Events
    - [ ] Objectives
    - [ ] Conditions
    - [ ] YAML for questers (old page still in place)

    The [old tutorial](./Getting-Started/Learn-BetonQuest.md) is still available in the mean time.
    We appreciate any feedback on the new tutorials!
