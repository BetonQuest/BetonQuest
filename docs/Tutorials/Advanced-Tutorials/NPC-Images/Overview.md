# NPC Images

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use pixel art images within your conversations. We'll guide you step-by-step 
through the process, ensuring you understand how to implement each component effectively.

By the end, you'll know how to create a basic resource pack and use Unicode glyphs as character names, enhancing the 
visual appeal and customization of your conversations.

!!! example "Related Docs"
    * [Conversations](../../../Documentation/Features/Conversations.md)
</div>

Sometimes, normal quest layouts can get a bit boring, and we crave something new and refreshing, like the designs found 
on popular larger servers. We can achieve this by using images that we added to our resource pack and now display inside 
our conversation using Unicode glyphs. This can look like the example below.

Assuming you are already skilled at creating quests and not a complete beginner, we won't provide a Quest-Package at this
stage. Instead, we encourage you to follow along with the tutorial.
