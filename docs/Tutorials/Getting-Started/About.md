# About the "Getting Started" Section

**Welcome to BetonQuest!** :material-hand-wave:

The plugin has tons of features and therefore requires some learning.
The "Getting Started" section will teach you the very basics of BetonQuest.
At first, you will:

  1. :material-server: Set up a local test server for quest development

  2. :fontawesome-solid-graduation-cap: Learn all BetonQuest basics by creating a questline

Additionally, there are many more tutorials that you can do later on.


If you get stuck at any point do not hesitate to ask for help in the [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/rK6mfHq).
