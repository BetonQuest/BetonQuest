## About
:octicons-clock-24:  30 minutes Â· :octicons-tag-16: Basics

In this tutorial you will learn the basics of the conversations. These allow you to create a dialog between the player
and a NPC. Therefore, these are the basic tool for story telling.


!!! danger "Requirements"
    Setup of:
    
    * [Setup Guide](../Setup-Guide/Setting-up-a-test-server.md)

    You don't need any experience in creating quests. This is the very beginning.

## 1. Package Setup

--8<-- "Tutorials/download-setup.md"
    ```
    /bq download BetonQuest/Quest-Tutorials main QuestPackages /Basics/Conversations/1-DirectoryStructure /tutorialQuest overwrite
    ```

You can now find all files needed for this tutorial in this location:
"_YOUR-SERVER-LOCATION/plugins/BetonQuest/QuestPackages/tutorialQuest_"    

## 2. Linking a conversation to a NPC

Usually, conversations happen between a NPC and the player. 
Therefore, we need to create the `npcs` section in the _package.yml_ so that the plugin knows which Citizens NPC
uses which conversation. This is how it works:

``` YAML title="package.yml" linenums="1"
npcs:
  '1': Jack
```
This links the NPC with the given ID (`1`) to the conversation with the given identifier (`Jack`).
Save the file after editing.

??? info "How to find the Citizens NPC ID"
    Execute this command if you haven't created an NPC yet: `/npc create Jack`  
    
    1. Stay close to the NPC you want to select
    2. Type the command `/npc select` to select the nearest NPC.
    3. Type the command `/npc id` to get the ID from your NPC.


## 3. Creating your first conversation

It's time to create the first conversation with Jack! This chapter will teach you the basic structure of a conversation.

Let's take a look at how a conversation is defined in the plugin's files:

!!! question ""
    **Tip:** Click the plus buttons next to the text for explanations! 

``` YAML title="jack.yml" linenums="1"
conversations:
  Jack: # (1)!
    quester: Jack # (2)!
    first: firstGreeting # (3)!
    NPC_options: # (4)!
      firstGreeting:
        text: Hello and welcome to my town traveler! Nice to see you. Where are you from?
        pointer: whereYouFrom # (5)!
   
    player_options: # (6)!
      whereYouFrom:
        text: First I want to know who you are!
```

1. This is the identifier of the conversation. Make sure this equals the conversation identifier in "_package.yml_". 
2. Defines the name of the NPC that displayed during the conversation.
3. Defines which `NPC_option` should be used as the start of the conversation.
4. This section contains everything the NPC says.
5. Defines which `player_option` is shown next. 
6. This section contains everything the player says.


A BetonQuest conversation is a cycle of responses between the NPC and the player.
Anything the NPC says is called `NPC_options`, all player text is called `player_options`.

A conversation always starts with an `NPC_option`. 
Now the player must answer the NPC using a `player_option`.

Options point to each other using the `pointer` argument. In the case of an NPC_option, the pointer argument would contain
the name of a `player_option`. 
Usually, a player has more than one answer to choose from. This is done by adding multiple `player_option` names to a
`NPC_option`.

After the player responded, they are shown another `NPC_option` that the previously chosen `player_option` points to.
  
Whenever either a `player_option` or a `NPC_option` point to no other option the conversation ends as there are no more
responses or answers.

!!! info "The Conversation Cycle"
    ``` mermaid
    graph LR
    X{Conversation Starts} --> C
    C[First NPC_option] --> A
    A[player_option] --> |Pointer|B[NPC_option];
    B --> |Pointer|A;
    A -.No pointer present .-> D
    B -.No pointer present .-> D
    D{Conversation Ends}
    ```
    
You can easily check if your quest is working on the server.
Open the file "_jack.yml_" in the "_conversations_" folder.
Copy the above conversation into it and save the file.
Now type `/bq reload` in the chat and right-click the NPC.

You can select the answer by pressing ++space++.

## 4. Conversations with multiple choices

Let's see how to create multiple responses for the player to choose from using the `pointer` argument.

A NPC_option can point to multiple player options at the same time.
As soon as a pointer argument contains more than one player option, the player can choose.

!!! question ""
    **Tip:** Highlighted lines are new compared with the previous example. 

``` YAMl title="jack.yml" hl_lines="9-15 19-25" linenums="1"
conversations:
  Jack:
    quester: Jack
    first: firstGreeting
    NPC_options:
      firstGreeting:
        text: Hello and welcome to my town traveler! Nice to see you. Where are you from?
        pointer: whereYouFrom
      whoAmI:
        text: I am &6Jack&r. The mayor of this beautiful town. We have some big farms and good old taverns well worth checking out! So now where are you from?
        pointer: smallIsland,bigCity # (1)!
      islandAnswer: 
        text: That sounds familiar! I grew up in a small town with few people. So we already have something in common! Do you want something to eat?
      cityAnswer: 
        text: Oh I know! I think you're from Kayra, right? Nice city but to be honest I prefer country life... You look a bit hungry. Do you want something to eat?
    
    player_options:
      whereYouFrom: 
        text: First I want to know who you are!
        pointer: whoAmI 
      smallIsland: # (2)!
        text: From a small island located east.
        pointer: islandAnswer # (4)!
      bigCity:  # (3)!
        text: From a big city located west.
        pointer: cityAnswer # (5)!
```

1. This npc_option points to multiple player_options. This allows the player to choose. The names of the player_options must be comma seperated.
2. The `whoAmI` npc_option points to me.
3. Gets pointed on by the `whoAmI` npc_option.
4. Points to `islandAnswer` `NPC_option`.
5. Points to the `cityAnswer` `NPC_option`.


With these changes, the mayor asks the player where he is from.
The player can either say that they are from a `smallIsland` or from a
`bigCity`. This creates two different paths through the conversation. 

Let's join these paths again to show the same ending:<br>
Add the same pointer argument to both paths' NPC_options. They point to the new `yesPlease` player_option.
``` YAML title="jack.yml" hl_lines="14 17-19 30-32" linenums="1" 
conversations:
  Jack:
    quester: Jack
    first: firstGreeting
    NPC_options:
      firstGreeting:
        text: Hello and welcome to my town traveler! Nice to see you. Where are you from?
        pointer: whereYouFrom
      whoAmI:
        text: I am &6Jack&r. The mayor of this beautiful town. We have some big farms and good old taverns well worth checking out! So now where are you from?
        pointer: smallIsland,bigCity
      islandAnswer:
        text: That sounds familiar! I grew up in a small town with few people. So we already have something in common! Do you want something to eat?
        pointer: yesPlease # (1)!
      cityAnswer:
        text: Oh I know! I think you're from Kayra, right? Nice city but to be honest I prefer country life... You look a bit hungry. Do you want something to eat?
        pointer: yesPlease # (2)!
      foodAnswer:
        text: You're welcome! Take it... &7*gives food*
    
    player_options:
      whereYouFrom:
        text: First I want to know who you are!
        pointer: whoAmI
      smallIsland:
        text: From a small island located east.
        pointer: islandAnswer
      bigCity:
        text: From a big city located west.
        pointer: cityAnswer
      yesPlease: # (3)!
        text: Oh yes I'm starving! Thank you.
        pointer: foodAnswer
```

1. I point to `yesPlease` in the `player_options` section.
2. I also point to `yesPlease` in the `player_options` section.
3. Two `NPC_options` point to me.

The following graph shows the paths through the conversation. Since there are two pointers assigned to the `whoAmI` option,
the player can choose between one of the paths.

!!! info "Conversation Flow Graph"
    ``` mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        [*] --> firstGreeting: Interaction with NPC
        firstGreeting --> whereYouFrom: points to
        whereYouFrom --> whoAmI: points to
        whoAmI --> smallIsland: points to
        whoAmI --> bigCity: points to
        smallIsland --> islandAnswer: points to
        bigCity --> cityAnswer: points to
        islandAnswer --> yesPlease: points to
        cityAnswer --> yesPlease: points to
    ```

Try the conversation ingame by saving the file and executing the `/bq reload` command!
Then right-click Jack.
Select different options using ++w++ and ++s++. Confirm them using ++space++.
