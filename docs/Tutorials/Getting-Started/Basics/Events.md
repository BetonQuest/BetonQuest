After you learned how to create conversations we will now take a look at events. These allow you to change the game 
world. This can be anything from modifying a player's inventory to placing blocks.  
In this tutorial, we will give the player items and teleport them to different locations using events.

    /bq download BetonQuest/Quest-Tutorials main QuestPackages /Basics/Conversations/1-DirectoryStructure /tutorialQuest
    ```
    You can now find all files needed for this tutorial in this location:
    "_YOUR-SERVER-LOCATION/plugins/BetonQuest/QuestPackages/tutorialQuest_"

## 1. Creating the folder structure for your first event

Add a new file to your "_tutorialQuest_" `QuestPackage` named "_events.yml_".
Here is an overview of what your directory structure should look like now:

* :material-folder-open: tutorialQuest
    - :material-file: package.yml
    - :material-file: {==events.yml==}
    - :material-folder-open: conversations
        - :material-file: jack.yml

We now have our file structure ready and can start writing events!

## 2. Defining your first event

Open the `events.yml` now that we have created it and add the following content: 

``` YAML title="events.yml" linenums="1"
events: # (1)!
  giveFoodToPlayer: "give steak:16"
```

1. All events must be defined in an `events` section.

So what do we see here?

* `giveFoodToPlayer`  is the name of the event. You are free to choose any name. However, it is  recommended to name 
   it after what it does. That just makes it easier to understand your quest.
*  The Event Instruction. 
    - `give` The first value in the instruction is always the **event type**.
    - `steak:16` This is an **option** of the give event. It defines which item you want to give and which amount 
      seperated by a colon.

Before we can test if the event works ingame we have to create the item `steak` because BetonQuest doesn't know what a `steak` is.

## 3. Creating the item in the items section

For some event types like `give` you need to specify an item in the `items` section.
It holds definitions of all items you want to create/use in your quest.
We will create the item section in the "_package.yml_" file. 

``` YAML title="package.yml" hl_lines="4-5" linenums="1"
npcs:
  '1': "Jack"

items:
  steak: "COOKED_BEEF" # (1)!
```

1. Links the `steak` item name from your BetonQuest configs to the ingame `minecraft:COOKED_BEEF` item.

Now `steak` is an item name that can be used throughout your quest.

## 4. Integrating events into conversations

Let's run the event from your conversation.

!!! question ""
    **Tip:** Highlighted lines in {==blue==} are new compared with the previous example. 

``` YAML title="jack.yml" hl_lines="9-10 13-14" linenums="1" 
conversations:
  Jack:
    quester: "Jack"
    first: "firstGreeting"
    NPC_options:
      #... (1)
      foodAnswer:
        text: "Your welcome! Take it... &7*gives food*"
        events: "giveFoodToPlayer" # (2)!
        pointer: "thankYou"
    player_options:
      #...
      thankYou: 
        text: "Oh that smells really good!"
```

1. The tutorial will only show relevant parts of the examples from now on. 
2. The event argument must contain one or multiple event names. These events are executed when the corresponding
   option is shown to the player.<br>This argument can be used on both player and npc options.


Make these changes to your conversation, reload and test! The NPC should now give the player food.

## 5. Testing your first event ingame

You can also run events using commands.

!!! warning ""
    It is very important to save all files everytime you test something!
    Type `/bq reload` on your server after saving.     
 
The easiest way to do this is by running a command:

Enter `/bq event NAME tutorialQuest.giveFoodToPlayer` on the server.
This command will give you the specified amount of steak if you've done everything right!

| Command Part       | Meaning                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/bq event`        | Tells BetonQuest that some event should be executed.                                                                              |
| `NAME`             | A player's name.                                                                                                                  |
| `tutorialQuest`    | The name of a QuestPackage. This is required because you could have events with the same name in different packages.              |
| `giveFoodToPlayer` | The name of the event to execute. Don't forget to separate it with a dot from the package `tutorialQuest{==.==}giveFoodToPlayer`. |

You can also run this command from the console (without the slash at the start).

## 6. Creating folder events

Now we will create a tour through the mayors city. Meanwhile, we will learn about the teleport and folder events.

Open the "_events.yml_" file and add these lines:                                                                                      
``` YAML title="events.yml" hl_lines="3-7" linenums="1"
events:
  giveFoodToPlayer: "give steak:16"
  townTour: "folder tpLocation1,tpLocation2,tpLocation3,tpBlacksmith delay:2 period:5"
  tpLocation1: "teleport 100;70;100;world" # (1)!
  tpLocation2: "teleport 200;73;200;world" # (2)!
  tpLocation3: "teleport 300;71;300;world" # (3)!
  tpBlacksmith: "teleport 50;70;50;world" # (4)!
```

1. Adjust this to your world. It must be in the [unified location format](../../../Documentation/Reference.md#unified-location-formating)
2. Adjust this to your world. It must be in the [unified location format](../../../Documentation/Reference.md#unified-location-formating)
3. Adjust this to your world. It must be in the [unified location format](../../../Documentation/Reference.md#unified-location-formating)
4. Adjust this to your world. It must be in the [unified location format](../../../Documentation/Reference.md#unified-location-formating)

As you can see, there are a few new events of the types `folder` and `teleport`.
The folder event wraps multiple events inside itself. Once triggered, it simply executes it's events. 
Every event type is documented in the events list, read more about the [folder](../../../Documentation/Events-List.md#run-multiple-events-folder)
and [teleport](../../../Documentation/Events-List.md#teleport-teleport) events there. 

Running the `townTour` event will teleport you to a new location every five seconds
until we get to our final destination, the blacksmith. The folder event is done after the `tpBlacksmith` event was run.

Now we will add the folder event to Jack's conversation.
``` YAML title="jack.yml" hl_lines="11-18 23-29" linenums="1" 
conversations:
  Jack:
    quester: "Jack"
    first: "firstGreeting"
    NPC_options:
      #...
      foodAnswer:
        text: "You're welcome! Take it... &7*gives food*"
        events: "giveFoodToPlayer"
        pointer: "thankYou"
      townTour:
        text: "Yeah that's true. You know what also smells good? The fresh air in my town! Would you like to take a little tour?"
        pointer: "enoughTime,noTimeForThat" # (1)!
      startTheTour:
        text: "Great! It is a honor for me to guide you through the town."
        events: "townTour" # (2)!
      noProblem:
        text: "That's fine! Maybe you have time another day... Just talk to me again. See you!"
    player_options:
      #...
      thankYou:
        text: "Oh that smells really good!"
        pointer: "townTour" # (3)!
      enoughTime:
        text: "Yes of course! Show me everything."
        pointer: "startTheTour"
      noTimeForThat:
        text: "Sorry but I don't have time now..."
        pointer: "noProblem"
```

1. The player once again has a choice.
2. This is the event name for the new event that we will create. It gets triggered when the `startTheTour` NPC option is shown.
3. This extends the existing conversation.

These modifications allow the player to choose whether they want to take a town tour or not.

Now speak with the NPC again to take the tour.

## Summary

You've learned what events are and how to create them. You can now give a player some food or
even teleport him through the whole town! More events can be found in the [events list](../../../Documentation/Events-List.md).
Next you will learn how to give tasks to the player using **objectives**.
