# Installation
1. In order to use [BetonQuest](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/betonquest.2117/) you (obviously)
   need to add the "_BetonQuest.jar_" that you downloaded from Spigot to the "_plugins_" folder in the server.
   If there is no plugin folder in your server's folder simply create one.

2. You also need [Citizens](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/citizens.13811/) for this
   tutorial. If you can't afford to buy it you can download it for free.
   Just give the first paragraph of their Spigot page a good read, and you will find the link.
   Also put the "_Citizens.jar_" file in your server's "_plugins_" folder.

3. You also need <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1997/" target="_blank">ProtocolLib</a> for this
   tutorial. Also put the "_ProtocolLib.jar_" file in your server's "_plugins_" folder.

Once you have installed these start up your server!
