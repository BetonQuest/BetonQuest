A new branch should always be created from an up to date `main` branch.
That's why you [added the BetonQuest repository](../Setup-Project.md#adding-remote-repository) `upstream`.
Now click on the `branch` menu from git in the top left corner of IntelliJ IDEA.
Then you click on `upstream/main` and click on `New Branch from 'upstream/main'...`.
Now give the branch a name that describes the changes you want to make and click `CREATE`.

A full guide on [Managing Git Branches](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/manage-branches.html)
can be found in the IntelliJ IDEA documentation.
