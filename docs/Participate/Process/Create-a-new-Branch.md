A new branch should always be created from an up to date `main` branch.
That's why you [added the BetonQuest repository](../Setup-Project.md#adding-remote-repository) `upstream`.
Now click on the `Git` icon in the bottom left corner of IntelliJ IDEA.
Then you click on `upstream/main` and click on `New Branch from Selected...`.
Now give the branch a name that describes the changes you want to make and click `CREATE`.

## Next Steps
Now you are ready to make your changes!
Either change [Docs](./Docs/Workflow.md#live-preview) or [Code](./Code/Workflow.md#maven-verify), depending on your skills.
