#Versioning and Releasing

##Versioning
BetonQuest follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification.

We adapt the specification with these version types:

* `1.12.0` for git version tags `v*` (in the official repository)
* `1.12.0-DEV-1` for commits to `master` or branches called `master_v*` (in the official repository)
* `1.12.0-DEV-ARTIFACT-5522` for commits to other branches (or repos) and Pull requests
* `1.12.0-DEV-UNOFFICAL` for local builds

Only use the three digits(Major, Minor, Patch) to specify versions in files like the pom.xml. All suffixes are set
by the build-pipeline.

The officially distributed jar does not contain the version in its name due to limits with the Spigot updater.
Therefore, it's named `BetonQuest.jar`. The version can only be seen ingame by using `/q version`.

##Releasing

This project has a custom build-pipeline that utilizes GitHub('s) actions.

###Step 1: Prerequisites

Check out the remote branch or commit, that you want to use for the release.
Make sure that the current version in all the files (pom.xml etc.) is the correct version that should be used for the
release. You will need a bash shell later on (e.g. Git Bash). Additionally, a Maven installation is required and must
be added to the path. Optionally GitHub-CLI can be installed too to enable functions like automatic Pull Request
creation and release date fetching.

###Step 2: Build a release

Run the script `./.github/scripts/release.sh` using some sort of bash shell (e.g. Git Bash) from the root dir of the
project. It will lead you through the creation of the release and prepare the next version.  
If you run into errors you may need to do the script's release steps manually or fix the script / your setup.
