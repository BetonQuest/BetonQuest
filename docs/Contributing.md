# Contributing

Do you like my work here? There are some ways you can help to make this plugin even better:

## New ideas

Need something? Or just have a brilliant idea? Head to the [Issues](https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest/issues) and create new one. Just remember to start the title with uppercase letter or I will edit it!

## Bug reports

Found a bug? Great, create new [issue](https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest/issues) so I can fix it in the next version!

## Translations

I love to see this plugin used by people from other countries. I would be happy if you could translate it to your language and share the translation with me. You can send me the edited _messages.yml_ file or submit a pull request.

## Contributing code

If you know Java and Bukkit you can take some issue and create pull request. Just let me know and remember these few things:

* The contributed code should be well tested and fully working.
* Use only spaces for indentation.
* Wrap your code at 120th character.
* Comment everything so the code is easy to understand for everyone.
* Use block comments to document classes, methods and fields.

## Positive feedback

I really like to hear that people are using my plugin. If you've got a server and have made a few quests just let me know so I can check it out ^^

## Donations

If you have some spare money and REALLY like this plugin you can donate [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KG6S76KP4W6UG). This project however is not dependent on donations, so it's really optional :)
