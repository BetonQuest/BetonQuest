  <h3><u>Draft</u></h3>
  Our own usage and testing has shown that this part of the API is complete and seems bug free.
  However, other plugins may have other use cases which are not covered by our testing.
  Therefore, please go ahead and use this API part. Let us know if there are missing features or bugs.
  This API part will be changed if there are more bugs, missing features or usability improvements.

  <h3><u>Stable</u></h3>
  Both our own and third party testing showed that this part of the API is complete.
  Only bugs and major conceptual problems would lead to more changes.
  This part of the API will only change over at least one major version and will likely carry deprecation as long as possible.

  **This part of the API should be safe to use. We try to keep it compatible with previous versions if changes are needed.**
