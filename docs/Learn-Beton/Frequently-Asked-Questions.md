***

**Q**: _Can you make conversation options clickable?_

**A**: Open _config.yml_ file and set `default_conversation_IO` option to "tellraw". You can also set it to "chest" if you want conversations to be displayed in an inventory GUI.

***

**Q**: _Can you add particles over NPCs' heads like in `Quests` plugin?_

**A**: Install [EffectLib](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/effectlib/).

***

**Q**: _The players don't know they have to end a conversation, can you add "auto-ending" when they walk away?_

**A**: Set `stop` option to "false" in conversation file.

***

**Q**: _I have an error which says "Cannot load plugins/BetonQuest/{someFile}.yml", what is wrong?_

**A**: You have incorrect YAML syntax in your conversation file. Check it with [YAML Lint](http://yamllint.com) to see what's wrong. Usually it's because you started a line with `!` or `&`, forgot colons or made some weird things with apostrophes.

***

**Q**: _Where is a command for creating quests?_

**A**: There is no such command. BetonQuest is too complex to edit it with chat, commands and inventory windows. If you don't like editing files directly you can get [the editor](https://github.com/BetonQuest/BetonQuest-Editor).

***

**Q**: _Conversations are not working! I created NPC "Innkeeper" and he won't talk to me._

**A**: Conversations are not linked to an NPC through names, as you can have multiple Innkeepers. You need to connect them with their ID. Read [this](../User-Documentation/Reference.md#npcs).

***

**Q**: _Could you add some feature?_

**A**: Check if it wasn't already added in [DEV-builds](https://betonquest.pl). You can see all changes in [the changelog](https://github.com/BetonQuest/BetonQuest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
