##Beautiful multi-threaded Conversations
Players can have immersive conversation with NPC's by utilizing BetonQuests Multi-Path-Conversation System.
Questers can freely define multi-threaded stories, narrated with NPC conversations,
and with multiple endings that affect a player's gameplay.
Questers can also choose between five different styles to display their conversations.

Questers can make use of BetonQuests notifyIO system that provides access to all of Minecafts GUI elements to display notifications.
Therefore you can provide information to your players like so:

BetonQuest makes it possible to provide NPC conversations in any language. Each player
can set his own language which means that - if translated - all conversations will be in the players native language.

You can give players information about where they are in a quest using the "Journal". The Journal is a book in which you can
write content based on the players actions.

##Player, NPC and Hologram Hider

BetonQuest allows you to hide Players from each other based on whatever conditions you define. The same works for NPC's
and HolographicDisplays Holograms.

##[Upcoming] First Class Item System 
 
BetonQuest allows for item customization far beyond what other plugins can do. You can use ANY item from ANY plugin
in your quests as rewards or conditions. BetonQuest also features a set of powerful item flags that will add non-vanilla
behaviour to your items. For example, you could make a proper "Quest Item" that cannot be thrown away**** and won't be dropped when the player dies.
This system is *really* powerful, read the [final concept](https://github.com/BetonQuest/BetonQuest/issues/1037#issuecomment-590513472)
to get an idea of what will be possible.

##Countless Integrations

BetonQuest supports dozens of plugins, ranging from standard plugins like WorldGuard/WorldEdit and Citizens to more advanced ones such as EffectLib. 

It also offers support for other quest plugins, so you can just keep your old quests and create further additions to your quest
lines based upon the progress in your old plugin.

If just Beton isn't enough you can always just hook into Skript or Denizen too.

Full list of integrations [here](User-Documentation/Compatibility.md).
