#Information for Owners

BetonQuest has [quite a lot of features](Features.md) and use cases. This page will give you an overview on where BetonQuest works best. 

##Advantages

* BetonQuest empowers your staff to write <u>**truly unique quests**</u>.    
  These can range from **basic daily quests** to **complete storylines** with multiple outcomes.
  It offers extensive customization options which enables your staff to also make your servers quests *look* special.

* This is a <u>**free, OpenSource**</u> project. Any custom features you need can be contributed.

* BetonQuest **integrates with 27 other plugins**.

* BetonQuest can not only be utilized for quests but for **light scripting**. Some users use BetonQuest as the "Backbone" of
  their server. This is made possible by our extensive support for 3th party plugins.
  You can even run Denizen and Skript scripts from BetonQuest!

* BetonQuests  **discord community** <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rK6mfHq" target="_blank">:fontawesome-brands-discord:</a>
  provides active **support** for you and your staff.

* This website provides **in-depth learning material** for your staff which teaches them all BetonQuest basics.
  It also has guides on related topics such as the setup of a local test server,
  so your main server will not get flooded with bugs while your staff learns to write quests.
  
##Disadvantages

* The creation of quests may take longer then with other plugins due to BetonQuests enormous flexibility.
  This is also true for the learning curve, your staff will need some time to learn BetonQuest.
  However, one of the goals of the further development of BetonQuest is to reduce the overhead that is needed for simple quests.
