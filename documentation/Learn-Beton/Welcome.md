!!! warning "About learning BetonQuest 1.12.X"
    It is not recommended to learn BetonQuest 1.12.X as it is a legacy version and will only receive bug fixes.
    Instead, start with 2.0.0-DEV! It's a complete overhaul of the plugin and has a lot of new features. 
    While it is still in development, more than 100 servers run it already as it's very stable.     

    There are also much better tutorials for 2.0.0!
