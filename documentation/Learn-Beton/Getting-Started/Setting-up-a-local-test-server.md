# Setting up a local test server

## Why do I need a local server?!

You might think that a local test server is useless because you already have a remote server.
There are multiple reasons why you **really** need one:

- Working on a live server could lead to crashes and bugs that your players will have to deal with.
- Making quests can, especially for new questers, lead to unexpected behavior. This can be anything from spawning
hundreds of mobs to endlessly giving out items to a player. Exactly the stuff you don't want to happen.
- Working with a test server is usually faster and therefore more productive. You can restart it all the time,
change plugin configurations as you wish etc.

##Setup of your local server

- **Step 1:** You have propably heard of Spigot, the biggest server software for 
Minecraft. We are going to install Paper (an improved version of Spigot) on your computer. 
Head over to <a href="https://papermc.io/downloads" target="_blank">Papers download page</a> and click on the button you
see in the image below (the numbers will not match up, ignore that).

- **Step 2:** Create a new folder for the server in a place you can easily access.
You really want to make sure to have nothing in it because that folder is
going to get quite a lot of files in it. Move the downloaded file here and rename it to `paper.jar`.

- **Step 3:** You need a start script to start your server.
Open your text editor and create a file named `start.bat` (For Linux and Mac: Create a `start.sh` file instead). 
Open it and copy this into it:
```
java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -jar paper.jar
```
This script tells java to search for a file named `paper.jar`.
The `1G` setting in both the `-Xms` and `-Xmx` options is how much RAM you want to give to the server 
(`1G` = 1 GigaByte RAM, `2G` = 2 GigaByte RAM, `700M` for 700 MegaBytes, etc.). You should not need more then 1GB in most
cases though.     
Make sure to save it as a `.bat` file! If you save it as a `.txt` file it will not work. 

- **Step 4:** Launch the server by double-clicking on the start file. A console window will appear and close after a while. Just wait until its gone.
Now check the server's folder. You will find a bunch of new folders and files that have been generated.
You need to accept the EULA (Minecrafts End-User-License-Agreement)to be able to run a Minecraft server.
You will find a link in the eula.txt file. After you read it you need to set `eula=false` to `eula=true`.
