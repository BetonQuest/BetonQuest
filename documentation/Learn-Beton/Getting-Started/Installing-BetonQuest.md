# Installation
In order to use <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/betonquest.2117/" target="_blank">BetonQuest</a> you (obviously)
need to add the `BetonQuest.jar` that you downloaded from Spigot to your plugins folder. If there is no plugin folder in your
servers folder simply create one.
You also need <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/citizens.13811/" target="_blank">Citizens</a> to make some cool 
looking NPC's. If you can't afford to buy it you can download it for free.
Just give the first paragraph of their Spigot page a good read and you will find the link. Also put the `Citizens.jar` file in your servers plugin folder.

Once you have installed these start up your server!
