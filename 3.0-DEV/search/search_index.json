We've used it on both a survival and a MMORPG server.</p> <p>I have 0 complaints. It's well thought through and getting better by the day. The day BetonQuest 2.0 (you can do like me and use the dev version) comes out, will be a beautiful day for all server owners.</p> <p>/Fred, Esron, Znitsarn.</p> <p>This is a brilliant plugin. It is so much more than just a plugin for quests. It is a set of tools that allow you to do so many things. I feel like this is a must have for any server that wants to add functionality to citizens NPCs even without using it for making quests. The possibilities are endless. You can have very immersive complex conversations that can be used to explain server functions, create shops, teleport players, make portals etc. [...] The possibilities are limited only by what you can think of doing. I started out looking for a quest plugin and after using this, I wished I had used it before just for the sake of the immersion it adds. [...]</p> <p>This is the most comprehensive quest plugin I have seen. I am still amazed this is free. The devs are extremely active, continue to make new things available, and have a clear roadmap to offering even more features. I am in awe of their skills and dedication.  I am truly blown away by the support team. They are the absolute best. They answer things quickly and thoroughly. I really cannot say enough good things about this quest plugin!</p> <p>This is actually my second review after 2 years which goes to show the complexity and skill behind this plugin. Many reviews have stated many times how powerful, complex and overall useful this plugin is. Comparing it to other quest plugins is simply not good because its so powerful I would put it on the level on a minor scripting language. The versatility and scale of this plugin has seen it develop to the backend of some powerful RPG servers! [...]  This is all taken however apart from the most important and influential part of the plugin and that is the developers. I have seen an entire range of developers come and go from the OG Co0sh to the current team and all of them have given it 110%. From releasing patches on the same day bugs have been reported to spending hours and hours in calls with users it is impossible not to realise how much the developers care about the plugin and all its users. Their care and hundreds of hours of dedication are shown in this insanely powerful and (mostly) bug free quest plugin. Anyone who aspires to give their players a  proper RPG experience needs to check this plugin out.

They extend <code>Objective</code> class. As always, you need to extract all data from supplied <code>Instruction</code> object in the constructor. Don't register listeners in the constructor!</p> <p>If your objective handles changing data (like amount of mobs left to kill) you should create a class extending <code>ObjectiveData</code>. For example <code>block</code> objective does need to store amount of blocks left to place/break, and it does that using \"BlockData\" class. In the constructor it receives three strings: data string, ID of the player and ID of the objective. The latter two are used by BetonQuest to correctly save and load the former one from the database.</p> <p>The data string should contains all the information you need in your objective. You must write a parser which will extract the information, methods used in the objective to alter the information, and override the <code>toString()</code> method in so it returns data string in the format parsable by your parser. Everytime the data in your object changes (like when killing a mob), you need to call <code>update()</code> method. It will save the data to the database.</p> <p>Now you should override <code>getDefaultDataInstruction()</code> method. It must return the default data instruction understandable by your parser. For example in <code>tame</code> objective it will return the amount of mobs to tame. If you don't use data objects, just return an empty string (not <code>null</code>, just <code>\"\"</code>).</p> <p>In order for your objective to use the data object you have created you need to set the <code>template</code> variable to this object's class. If you're not defining the data object (because you don't need to handle the changing data), you should set the <code>template</code> simply to <code>ObjectiveData.class</code>.</p> <p>Every time your objective accepts the player's action (for example killing the right mob in MobKill objective) it must be also verified with <code>checkConditions()</code> method. You don't want your objective ignoring all conditions, right? When you decide that the objective is completed you should call <code>completeObjective()</code> method. It will fire all events for you, so you don't have to do this manually.</p> <p><code>start()</code> and <code>stop()</code> methods must start objective's listeners and stop them accordingly. It's because the plugin turns the objective's listeners off if there are no players having it active. Here usually you will register/unregister listeners, but some objectives may be different. For example <code>delay</code> objective starts and cancels a runnable, instead of using listeners.</p> <p>If your objective has some properties (used in variables) you should override the <code>String getProperty(String property, String playerID)</code> method. At runtime, if anyone uses <code>%objective.yourObjective.theProperty%</code> variable, BetonQuest will call that method with <code>theProperty</code> keyword as the first argument. Using it you should parse the data of the objective and return it as a String. If the supplied property name is incorrect or there was an error during getting the value, return an empty String and optionally log an error (<code>LogUtils.getLogger().log(...)</code>).</p> <p>Objectives are registered the same way as conditions and events, using <code>registerObjective(String name, Class&lt;? extends Objective&gt;)</code> method.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>IDE's typically autocomplete the wrong constructor.

Each item has an instruction string, similarly to events, conditions etc.</p> <p>BetonQuest provides the <code>simple</code> item type, which this page describes. Basic syntax is very simple:</p> <pre><code>item: simple BLOCK_SELECTOR other arguments...\n</code></pre> <p>BLOCK_SELECTOR is a type of the item. It doesn't have to be all in uppercase. Other arguments specify data like name of the item, lore, enchantments or potion effects. There are two categories of these arguments: the ones you can apply to every item and type specific arguments. Examples would be <code>name</code> (for every item type) and <code>text</code> (only in books).</p> <p>Every argument is used in two ways: when creating an item and when checking if some existing item matches the instruction. The first case is pretty straightforward - BetonQuest takes all data you specified and creates an item, simple as that. Second case is more complicated. You can require some property of the item to exist, other not to exist, or skip this property check altogether. You can also accept an item only if some value (like enchantment level) is greater/less than x. You can use wildcards in the BLOCK_SELECTOR to match multiple types of items.</p> <p>These are arguments that can be applied to every item:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>name</code> - the display name of the item. Underscores will be replaced with spaces. You can escape them with <code>\\_</code> and you can also escape the <code>\\</code> with <code>\\\\_</code>. You can also use <code>&amp;</code> color codes.  If you want to specifically say that the item must not have any name, use <code>none</code> keyword.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>lore</code> - text under the item's name. Default styling of lore is purple and italic.  You can escape them with <code>\\_</code> and you can also escape the <code>\\</code> with <code>\\\\_</code>. You can also use <code>&amp;</code> color codes. To make a new line use <code>;</code> character. If you require the item not to have a lore at all, use <code>none</code> keyword. By default, lore will match only if all lines are exactly the same. If you want to accept all items that contain specified lines (and/or more lines), add <code>lore-containing</code> argument to the instruction string.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>enchants</code> - a list of enchantments and their levels. Each enchantment consists of these things, separated by colons:</p> <ul> <li>name</li> <li>level (only positive numbers, including zero)</li> </ul> <p>For example <code>damage_all:3</code> is Sharpness III. You can specify additional enchantments by separating them with commas.</p> <p>You can require the item not to have any enchantments by using <code>none</code> keyword. You can also add <code>+</code>/<code>-</code> character to the enchantment level to make the check require levels greater/less (and equal) than specified. If you don't care about the level, replace the number with a question mark.</p> <p>By default, all specified enchantments are required. If you want to check if the item contains a matching enchantment (and/or more enchants), add <code>enchants-containing</code> argument to the instruction string. Each specified enchantment will be required on the item by default unless you prefix its name with <code>none-</code>, for example <code>none-knockback</code> means that the item must not have any knockback enchantment. Do not use <code>none-</code> prefix unless you're using <code>enchants-containing</code> argument, it doesn't make any sense and will break the check!</p> </li> <li> <p><code>unbreakable</code> - this makes the item unbreakable.    You can specify it either as <code>unbreakable</code> or <code>unbreakable:true</code> to require an item to be unbreakable.

It defines the radius where the party members will be looked for. A range of 0 will look for all players in the same world as the player who triggered the event. And a range of -1 will look for all players in all worlds. Second is a list of conditions. Only the players that meet those conditions will be  considered as members of the party.

So <code>4+0.35~1</code> will produce <code>4.4</code> and <code>4.2~0</code> will produce <code>4</code>.</p> <p>To use variables in the calculation you have two options: First just write the variable, but  without <code>%</code> around them; In cases where this doesn't work, e.g. if the variable contains mathematical operators, you can surround it with curly braces <code>{ }</code>. Inside the curly braces you have to escape with <code>\\</code>, so to have a <code>\\</code> in your variable you need to write <code>\\\\</code>, to have a <code>}</code> inside your variable you need to write <code>\\}</code>.</p> <p>When the calculation fails <code>0</code> will be returned and the reason logged.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>The modulo operator needs to be escaped with a backslash <code>\\</code> to prevent it from being interpreted as a placeholder delimiter. If you don't want to escape the percentage and actually want to write a backslash you can use <code>\\\\%</code>. Don't forget to escape the backslash itself with another backslash if you are inside a double-quoted string <code>\"</code>.</p> <pre><code>%math.calc:100*(15-point.reputation.amount)%\n%math.calc:objective.kill_zombies.left/objective.kill_zombies.total*100~2%\n%math.calc:-{ph.myplugin_stragee+placeholder}%\n%math.calc:64\\%32%\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Documentation/Scripting/Building-Blocks/Variables-List/#npc-variable","title":"Npc Variable","text":"<p>static</p> <p>This variable resolves information about a Npc.

Therefore, you should understand that we try to avoid <code>null</code> completely. To achieve this, by default everything is annotated with <code>@NotNull</code>, disallowing <code>null</code> values. If you want to allow <code>null</code> values, you have to annotate the field or method with <code>@Nullable</code>. With this knowledge, you may understand the error a bit better, but if not give it a read in the NullAway documentation.</p> <p>Visit the PMD Page for general info.  PMD mainly checks for code smells. PMD's errors look like this: <pre><code>[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-pmd-plugin:3.14.0:check (default) on project betonquest: You have 1 PMD violation.\n</code></pre> If you have this message you also have messages, that looks like this: <pre><code>[INFO] PMD Failure: org.betonquest.betonquest.BetonQuest:143 Rule:AvoidLiteralsInIfCondition Priority:3 Avoid using Literals in Conditional Statements.\n</code></pre> If you read this, you may know what is wrong.

If you need help solving an issue here, you can also ask us on our Discord for help with CheckStyle. </p> <p>Visit the EditorConfig Page for general info.  EditorConfig it natively supported by many IDEs and editors. It checks for some really basic formatting like brackets, line endings, indention and some more.
